Based on the data of campus smart cards, which include not only static demographic information but also dynamic behavioral data from more than 30000 anonymous students, in this paper, the evolution features of friendship and the relations between behavior characters and student interactions are investigated. On the one hand, four different evolving friendship networks are constructed by means of the friend ties proposed in this paper, which are extracted from monthly consumption records. In addition, the features of the giant connected components (GCCs) of friendship networks are analyzed via social network analysis (SNA) and percolation theory. On the other hand, two high-level behavior characters, orderliness and diligence, are adopted to analyze their associations with student interactions. Our experiment/empirical results indicate that the sizes of friendship networks have declined with time growth and both the small-world effect and power-law degree distribution are found in friendship networks. Second, the results of the assortativity coefficient of both orderliness and diligence verify that there are strong peer effects among students. Finally, the percolation analysis of orderliness on friendship networks shows that a phase transition exists, which is enlightening in that swarm intelligence can be realized by intervening the key students near the transition point. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus

In a Finnish online image-board, socially withdrawn individuals anonymously take part in conversations concerning, for example, welfare and the difficulties of working life. The aim of this study is to bring new perspectives to the discussion about anonymous online communication, and especially its relationship with social exclusion and anti-social behaviour. In the article, I examine how ‘the anti-social’ is produced and understood in this anonymously used forum. Through a thematically constructed textual analysis of online discussions, the following questions are answered: What kinds of life-political themes are found in the discussion concerning social withdrawal? How is the feeling of being an outsider in one’s own society voiced in this online community? What kind of space for public discussion does this specific forum provide? In the online space, an intimate public is formed around shared narratives and the conversations seem to offer at least a space of expressive politics and social criticism for the participants in a situation that is labelled by precariousness. © The Author(s) 2018.",Article,Scopus

While OTTs have access to their own analytics data with detailed information, ISPs often have to rely on automated network probes for estimating streaming quality, and likewise, academic researchers have no information on actual customer behavior. In this paper, we present first results from a large-scale crowdsourcing study in which three major video streaming OTTs were compared across five major national ISPs in Germany. We not only look at streaming performance in terms of loading times and stalling, but also customer behavior (e.g., user engagement) and Quality of Experience based on the ITU-T P.1203 QoE model. We used a browser extension to evaluate the streaming quality and to passively collect anonymous OTT usage information based on explicit user consent. Our data comprises over 400,000 video playbacks from more than 2,000 users, collected throughout the entire year of 2019. The results show differences in how customers use the video services, how the content is watched, how the network influences video streaming QoE, and how user engagement varies by service. Hence, the crowdsourcing paradigm is a viable approach for third parties to obtain streaming QoE insights from OTTs. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus

This study sought to distinguish between risks associated with intensive partner-seeking (i.e., individuals seeking out casual sex frequently across many venues) and risks associated with specific venues (e.g., GSNs, dating websites, offline activities). Expanding upon a literature predominantly focused on the population of men who have sex with men (MSM), we recruited a broader range of sexual identities. A convenience sample of 3180 participants from the U.S. (18–75 years old, 69% female, 75% Caucasian, 68% heterosexual) completed an anonymous, cross-sectional online survey. Logistic regressions yielded adjusted odds ratios highlighting the unique links between each predictor and sexual risk-taking. MSM/WSW indicators, quantity of partner-seeking and specific venues—particularly GSN use—emerged as robust predictors of sexual risk, increasing the odds of reporting all six outcomes examined: (1) having three or more sex partners in the last year, (2) having hookups in the last 2 months, (3) having hookups involving alcohol or (4) drug use, (5) condomless sexual activity with new partners in the last 2 months, and (6) ever having had a sexually transmitted infection. Although a large portion of risk originated from the proclivities of the individuals seeking casual sex, both online and offline methods of partner-seeking also contributed significant risk, suggesting that specific venues like GSN apps could be used as methods of targeting higher-risk behaviors. The results also highlight the importance of moving beyond MSM when addressing sexual risk. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,Scopus

SN can be a pervasive technology which can result in ""risky behaviours"". Issues linked to such behaviours have been investigated in a variety of contexts abroad (however, less so in the Malaysian context). The study aims at investigating Malaysian Secondary school students’ awareness of the risks and dangers of SN. A quantitative approach involving a questionnaire survey was used to collect data. The questionnaire was designed to elicit information from the students regarding their awareness of the risks and dangers as well as abuse of the SN systems such as cyberbullying, harassment, sexting etc. The questionnaire was distributed to all available Form Four students from four selected schools in the Klang Valley and Selangor i.e. an urban school, a suburban school, a rural school and an elite school. The quantitative study was conducted on 562 students from the four schools. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used in analysing the data. The findings revealed that there was no rural-urban divide with regard to awareness of the risks and dangers involved in SN. Students in general seemed to be aware of the risks and dangers of SN. Likewise, there was no clear rural-urban divide regarding awareness of privacy issues. However, there was some ignorance regarding certain risks. For example, they were generally not aware that it was not possible to stay anonymous online. There were also some marked differences across school-types. © 2020, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Press. All rights reserved.",Article,Scopus

In the era of the internet, individuals often make payments through various financial platforms such as mobile payments, bank's online interfaces, etc. This paper presents an analysis of a large person-to-person (P2P) financial transactional network of three Baltic countries, namely Estonia, Latvia and, Lithuania. We collaborated with one of the largest financial institutions operating in these three countries to analyse an anonymous dataset of more than two million customers. We modeled these transactions from network science and explored the data with four different objectives. The first objective was to explore the network of transactions from a structural perspective and interpret their meanings. The next two objectives included the attributes of the nodes. In the second objective, we analysed the network for the similarity of interacting nodes in terms of income level. In the third objective, we analysed the spending pattern similarity among the interacting customers. The fourth objective aimed at exploring the relation between income and spending patterns. Our results indicate that the online payment network of Estonia is the most intact, among all the three countries, confirming the slogan of e-Estonia and Lithuanian network being the most fragmented. In addition, Latvia and Lithuania are more similar to each other in terms of their income vs. similarity patterns compared to Estonia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that has studied such a large P2P financial network across three countries and the results of this study can provide insight into the financial behavior of the three Baltic countries. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus

This study details the environmental health risk perception and its determinants in Italian university students, including a measure of functional health literacy and an analysis of newspapers and social media. A cross sectional survey was carried out among students from 15 Italian universities and different disciplines (grouped into Scientific-Health and Humanistic-Legal-Social sectors) using a self-administered anonymous questionnaire, divided into six sections: socio-demographic characteristics, information on health and environment, environmental health risk perception, trust, attitudes and behaviors and functional health literacy. Local newspapers and tweets in the same areas and period were analyzed in relation to quantity and topics. The study population included 4778 students (65.1% female) aged 21 ± 4.3 years, and functional health literacy was low (below the cutoff value) for 44.4% of students. A new outcome of the survey is that the detected association between high functional health literacy a higher global health risk perception and trust in institutions both as sources of information and as actors for protection against environmental risks. The internet and social networks were the most frequently consulted sources of information (77.7%), which was predictive of a higher risk perception. The possible relation between environmental health risk perception and tweet communication was highlighted by a comparison between the risk perception in the city with the highest number of tweets (Modena) and another one similar for socio-demographic characteristics (Pisa). In conclusion, the results of our study may be of help to strengthen information and education programs: functional health literacy should be taken into account in school programs, to produce a basic knowledge for a better understanding of health and environment. Moreover, mass and social media should be included in planning communication intervention and in verifying their results. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

Thematic analysis of data collected was undertaken to identify and develop themes relevant to Ask.fm use. Findings indicate that the platform is a space where adolescents interact with others as part of their identity exploration. The role of anonymity was salient throughout. Ask.fm users were aware of the risks related to using the site; yet, the possibilities for fun, peer acceptance, and identity exploration may be driving them to experiment with this risky behavior.

Doctors’ social media use patterns and online professionalism have been thoroughly studied. Various unprofessional behaviors such as excessive self-disclosure, violations of patient privacy and improper social media posts, were observed. However, studies exploring nurses’ social media use and online professionalism are lacking. Objectives: The objective of this study was to understand the social media use and online professionalism of Chinese registered nurses. Design: A cross-sectional survey was adopted. Settings: Eight nursing conferences and one continuing-education program that took place in Sichuan, China. Participants: Convenience sampling was applied to select nurses who had obtained their Chinese nursing certificates, who were aged 18 years and above, and who worked in clinical settings. The final sample consisted of 658 registered nurses. Methods: Data were collected through the on-site distribution of an anonymous researcher-designed questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 41 items that focused on demographic and professional information, social media use and online professionalism. Medians, averages and percentages were used to describe the social media use patterns and online professionalism of Chinese registered nurses. Results: All participants in this study were social media users and 84.5% of them believed that social media had positively influenced their clinical practice. WeChat was the most frequently used form of social media, which was used among 93.5% of the subjects. Common reasons for social media use included receiving messages from work, networking, receiving news and relaxing. Approximately 56% of the participants spent one to three hours on social media daily. Most of the participants had reposted medical knowledge on social media and had subscribed to at least one medical social media account. Additionally, 67.2% of the sample disclosed that they “often” communicate work-related information with colleagues via social media. Roughly 50% of the sample insisted that their facilities had social media guidelines. Registered nurses’ professionalism was also assessed. Around half of the participants had received “friend request” from patients, while 63.5% of the sample acknowledged that there were no patients on their most frequently used social media platforms. About 7.6% of the respondents had “sometimes” posted identifiable patient information, which was much lower than the reported 32.5% rate of witnessing colleagues’ disclosure of identifiable patient information. Fully 50.3% of the participants indicated that they had witnessed improper posts by colleagues. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus

To find the right opportunities, LinkedIn needs to understand each member's skill set and their expertise levels accurately. However, estimating members' skill expertise is challenging due to lack of ground-truth. So far, the industry relied on either hand-created small scale data, or large scale social gestures containing a lot of social bias (e.g., endorsements). In this paper, we develop the Social Skill Validation, a novel framework of collecting validations for members' skill expertise at the scale of billions of member-skill pairs. Unlike social gestures, we collect signals in an anonymous way to ensure objectiveness. We also develop a machine learning model to make smart suggestions to collect validations more efficiently. With the social skill validation data, we discover the insights on how people evaluate other people in professional social networks. For example, we find that the members with higher seniority do not necessarily get positive evaluations compared to more junior members. We evaluate the value of social skill validation data on predicting who is hired for a job requiring a certain skill, and model using social skill validation outperforms the state-of-the art methods on skill expertise estimation by 10%. Our experiments show that the Social Skill Validation we built provides a novel way to estimate the members' skill expertise accurately at large scale and offers a benchmark to validate social theories on peer evaluation. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Conference Paper,Scopus

It examines the reasons behind the turn to anonymous social networking and also considers the ways in which anonymity impacts consumers’ self-performances on SNS. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a netnographic approach to explore Yik Yak across eight universities in Ireland and the UK. Data are based on observation and participation on the app. Screenshots on smart phones were the central method used to collect data. Data also included 12 in-depth interviews. Findings: Young consumers are becoming fatigued by the negative effects of self-presentation on many SNS. By enabling consumers to engage in what they consider to be more authentic modes of being and interaction, Yik Yak provides respite from these pressures. Through the structures of its design, Yik Yak enables consumers to realise self-authentication in anonymised self-performances that engender a sense of virtue and social connection. Practical implications: This research highlights the potential value of anonymous SNS in fostering supportive dialogue, concerning mental health amongst post-millennials. Originality/value: By invoking a performative lens, this paper extends a novel theoretical approach to understandings of identity formation within consumer research. By highlighting anonymity as a dynamic process of socio-material enactments, the study reveals how consumers’ self-performances are brought into effect through the citation of various discursive arrangements, which promulgate distinct understandings of authenticity. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,Scopus

Normally, published trajectories are often anonymized by replacing real identities of mobile objects with pseudonyms (e.g., random identifiers); however, privacy leaks can hardly be prevented. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm of de-anonymization attack re-identifying trajectories of victims from anonymous trajectory datasets. Different from existing attacks, no background knowledge or side channel information about the target dataset is required. Instead, we claim that, for each moving object, there exist some mobility patterns that reflect the preference or usual behavior of the object, and will not change dramatically over a period of time. As long as those relatively stable patterns can be extracted from trajectories and be utilized as quasi-identifiers, trajectories can be linked to anonymous historical ones. To implement such kind of de-anonymization attacks, an adversary only needs to collect a few trajectory segments of a victim, the durations of which do not necessarily overlap with that of trajectories in the target dataset (in simple terms, those trajectory segments are not necessary sub-trajectories included in the target dataset). Since the movements of victims in public areas could be observed openly, an adversary can obtain traces or locations about the victims either by direct monitoring them (e.g., tracking) or from third parties (e.g., social-networks). Then, the adversary extracts useful patterns from both the historical trajectories in the accessible dataset and newly obtained trajectory segments of victims, the historical trajectory with most similar patterns to that of a victim is considered as belonging to the victim. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of such attacks, we conduct extensive trace-driven simulations. We extract road segment preferences and stop of interests from trajectories of vehicles, and construct feature vectors (mobility patterns) of vehicles according to them, used for trajectory comparisons. Simulation results show that the adversary could re-identify anonymous trajectories effectively. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",Article,Scopus

Motivated by the need to account for the idiosyncratic resources available in each shopper’s SN, we distinguish between two types of opinion-seeking behaviours: (i) exploiting, seeking peers’ opinions in one’s core network (ie, online friends), and (ii) exploring, seeking peers’ opinions from one’s extended network (ie, strangers). Using SN theory, we specify what drives these behaviours, and how they influence shoppers’ utilitarian and hedonic experiences in an online product selection task. A free-simulation study, conducted with a restaurant review website connected to the Facebook SN, provided three key insights: (1) Exploitation has a stronger beneficial effect on shoppers’ utilitarian and hedonic experiences than exploration, (2) there is a strong positive influence of social capital (both structural and relational) on shoppers’ propensity to engage in exploitation, and (3) high social capital does not induce the expected extensive substitution of exploration with exploitation. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of online shoppers’ opinion seeking in the increasingly prevalent SN-enabled settings. ©, © Operational Research Society.",Article,Scopus

In 2012, we conducted a laboratory experiment in Boston, Massachusetts with 679 individuals to understand how anonymous online communication affects individual prevention decisions. Participants had to opt for or against investing in prevention over three sessions, each consisting of 15 experimental rounds. In the third session only, participants could share their experiences with a group of 1–3 other anonymous participants after each round. Groups exchanged an average of 16 messages over the 15 rounds of the third session. 70% of messages contained information about the subject’s prevention decision and the resulting health outcome. Participants were more likely to communicate when they prevented than when they did not, with prevention failures resulting in the highest probability of sending a message. Nonetheless, receiving an additional message reporting prevention increased the odds a subject would prevent by 32 percent.

Based on theory and previous studies, the principal purpose of this present study is to probe and understand whether and how the use of WeChat is related to individuals’ friendship quality and psychological well-being. Research participants were a total of 508 college students who completed anonymous questionnaires gauging their WeChat usage behaviors, self-disclosure, friendship quality, and well-being. Using structural equation modeling, results demonstrate that the intensity of WeChat use is significantly correlated with college students’ quality of friendships but not with perceived well-being. Moreover, the outcomes also reveal that students’ friendship quality is a significant predictor of well-being. However, there is no relationship between online self-disclosure and friendship quality or well-being. Overall, these obtained findings of the empirical study could cast a much-needed light on the nuanced understanding of the certain social and technological affordances of WeChat and how it may ultimately impact individual's quality of life in the new media context. © 2018 The Author",Article,Scopus

More than 70% of new cases have occurred in those aged 15–34 years. Condomless anal intercourse (CAI) has been identified as the main route of HIV transmission among MSM. To systematically examine CAI intention and associated factors among young MSM in Taiwan, an anonymous online survey based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was conducted. Data from 694 MSM aged 15–39 years were included in the analysis. This study found that, overall, all five TPB factors (i.e., attitudes toward positive and negative outcomes regarding CAI, perceived support for CAI from important others, and perceived behavioral control of CAI under facilitating and constraining conditions) were significantly associated with CAI intention. When data were stratified by sexual role (i.e., receptive, versatile, and insertive), the associations between TPB factors and CAI intention varied. Of the five TPB factors, positive attitudes toward positive outcomes regarding CAI were most strongly associated with high CAI intention (AOR 5.68 for all young MSM; AOR 3.80–15.93, depending on sexual role). Findings from this study could inform the development of theory-driven HIV prevention programs as well as future research and practice. These results also highlight the importance of tailoring HIV prevention initiatives for young MSM of different sexual roles to optimize the program effectiveness. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Article,Scopus

The potential moderating effects of sexual orientation and gender characteristic (masculine/feminine) were also explored. Anonymous survey data were collected from 929 students enrolled in a boys’ senior high school in Taiwan (response rate: 89.9%). Multivariate logistic regression analyses found higher condom use intentions linked to more positive ATB (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 8.09) and supportive SN (AOR = 2.73), as well as high PBC under facilitating conditions (AOR = 2.04). Notably, nonheterosexual boys perceiving supportive SN (AOR = 0.23) or high support for condom use from teachers and health educators (AOR = 0.10 and 0.26, respectively) had lower condom use intentions than their heterosexual peers. By contrast, relatively feminine boys perceiving supportive SN (AOR = 2.06) or high support from close friends (AOR = 2.18) had higher condom use intentions than their masculine counterparts. In conclusion, ATB and SN were strongly linked to condom use intentions; PBC was significant only under facilitating conditions. Sexual orientation and gender characteristic had important moderating effects. These empirical findings could inform tailored health education programs to increase condom use intentions in the male student population. ©, Copyright © The Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.",Article,Scopus

However, when such analyses can target single individuals rather than society as a whole, it is clear that privacy becomes a serious concern. This article addresses the challenge of publishing social graphs with proven privacy guarantees. In our adversarial model we consider an active attacker, who has the capability of altering the structure of the social graph before publication by creating new user profiles and establishing relations between them and the targeted network users. We aim to protect graphs satisfying (1, 1)-anonymity, the privacy property that char-acterises the weakest graphs in terms of resistance to active attacks. To that end, we introduce a class of perturbation methods based on edge additions that transform a (1, 1)-anonymous graph into a graph satisfying (k, ℓ)-anonymity for some k > 1 or some ℓ > 1. We prove the correctness of our approach and give a tight upper bound on the number of necessary edge additions. Experimental results, obtained on real-life graphs and a large collection of randomly generated graphs, show that our methods effectively prevent attacks from active adversaries with the capability of adding one node to the network, and additionally provide some level of protection against more capable attackers. We also conducted experiments on real-life social graphs which show that the outputs of state-of-the-art community detection algorithms on the anonymised graphs is similar to those obtained on the original graphs. © 2018, University of Skovde.

With the rapid growth of social networks on the Web, the most of interactions are conducted among unknown individuals. On the other hand, with increasing the biased behaviors in online communities, ability to assess the level of trustworthiness of a person before interacting with him has an important influence on users' decisions. Trust inference is a method used for this purpose. This paper studies propagating trust values along trust relationships in order to estimate the reliability of an anonymous person from the point of view of the user who intends to trust him/her. It describes a new approach for predicting trust values in social networks. The proposed method selects the most reliable trust paths from a source node to a destination node. In order to select the optimal paths, a new relation for calculating trustable coefficient based on previous performance of users in the social network is proposed. In ciao dataset there is a column called helpfulness. Helpfulness values represent previous performance of users in the social network. Advantages of this algorithm is its simplicity in trust calculation, using a new entity in dataset and its improvement in accuracy. The results of the experiments on Ciao dataset indicate that accuracy of the proposed method in evaluating trust values is higher than well-known methods in this area including TidalTrust, MoleTrust methods. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus

One problem lies in that nicknames are frequently changed in online communities, and automatically filtering nicknames is difficult when they are constantly malicious. Another problem is data fragmentation in which the data of the same user exists under different nicknames due to the first problem.

We recruit participants from traditional villages on Yasawa Island, Fiji. Yasawan religion includes belief in both universalistic Christian teachings and local deified ancestor spirits (Kalou-vu). Yasawans’ contrasting reliance on local, kin-based social networks and anonymous economic market exchange provides an interesting test case for how religious beliefs interact with wider social structures. We use an experimental priming procedure to test whether reminders of Christian vs. traditional imagery, as compared to neutral, influence local or self-favoritism in the random allocation game (RAG). We find that traditional imagery caused increased local–but not self–favoritism. Priming effects depended upon perceived resource uncertainty: participants primed with Christian imagery were most likely to allocate to distant co-religionists when they were least worried about resources. However, more uncertainty predicted higher local RAG allocations, further suggesting the importance of local social networks for managing such uncertainty. We further find additional support for previous findings that prosocial effects of punitive supernatural agent beliefs depend upon uncertainty.

As making friends is a basic way to create user's social relationship, friend recommendation is proposed to help users expand their social circles in OSNs. However, traditional friend recommendation process poses several crucial privacy breaches in OSNs, such as identity theft and relationship privacy leakage. Aimed to solve this problem, different from traditional friend recommendation schemes, based on the common interests by characterizing user's social behaviors/activities, we identify the threat model, and then propose a k-degree anonymous friend recommendation (KFR) scheme. Firstly, we abstract OSN as a hypergraph and then propose an edge segmentation algorithm to hide user's identity privacy and social relationship privacy. Subsequently, based on users’ common interests, we design a similarity calculation algorithm. Finally, combined the similarity calculation algorithm with the segmentation tree (ST) technique, a novel k-degree anonymous friend recommendation scheme is proposed. The experiments carried out on real datasets show that the proposed scheme is scalable and effective. © 2017",Article,Scopus

Measures included sociodemographic characteristics, Tinder use, health related behaviors, risky sexual behaviors, and sexual attitudes. Associations among these variables were estimated using multivariate logistic regressions. The final sample consisted of 415 participants (n = 166 Tinder users; n = 249 nonusers). Greater likelihood of using Tinder was associated with a higher level of education (OR = 2.18) and greater reported need for sex (OR = 1.64), while decreased likelihood of using Tinder was associated with a higher level of academic achievement (OR = 0.63), lower sexual permissiveness (OR = 0.58), living with parents or relatives (OR = 0.38), and being in a serious relationship (OR = 0.24). Higher odds of reporting nonconsensual sex (OR = 3.22) and having five or more previous sexual partners (OR = 2.81) were found in Tinder users. Tinder use was not significantly associated with condom use. This study describes significant correlates of using Tinder and highlights a relationship between Tinder use with nonconsensual sex and number of previous sexual partners.

It has been shown that ants estimate local population density by tracking encounter rates: The higher the density, the more often the ants bump into each other. We study distributed density estimation from a theoretical perspective. We prove that a group of anonymous agents randomly walking on a grid are able to estimate their density within a small multiplicative error in few steps by measuring their rates of encounter with other agents. Despite dependencies inherent in the fact that nearby agents may collide repeatedly (and, worse, cannot recognize when this happens), our bound nearly matches what would be required to estimate density by independently sampling grid locations. From a biological perspective, our work helps shed light on how ants and other social insects can obtain relatively accurate density estimates via encounter rates. From a technical perspective, our analysis provides tools for understanding complex dependencies in the collision probabilities of multiple random walks. We bound the strength of these dependencies using local mixing properties of the underlying graph.

On this platform, two types of interactions occurred as follows: (1) responses to a randomly distributed problem submitted by an advice seeker and (2) the seeker's indication of approval of any of the responses given. The study found that (1) a receiver was more likely to respond to problems submitted by seekers of a comparable age and that (2) seekers were more likely to approve of a response if the seeker and receiver had similar educational backgrounds. By contrast, homophily based on personality traits was not observed even though some personality traits significantly affected the likelihood of both response and approval. Our findings suggest that online communication may breed sociodemographic homophily, whether based on age or education, more than expected or intended while not easily fostering alternative forms of homophily, such as personality homophily, which can potentially cut across borders dividing sociodemographic groups. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.",Article,Scopus

In this paper we specifically focus on a popular WeChat sub-service, namely, the People Nearby service, which is exemplary of a find-and-flirt service, similar to those on Momo and Tinder. Specifically, the People Nearby service reads in the current geographic location of the device to locate a list of other people using WeChat who are in the same vicinity. The user can then request to establish a WeChat friendship relation with any of the users on the list. In this paper, we explore: (i) if one gender tends to use the People Nearby service more than another; (ii) if users of People Nearby are more anonymous than ordinary WeChat users; (iii) if ordinary WeChat users are more anonymous than Twitter users. We also take an in-depth examination of the user anonymity and demographics in a combined fashion and examine: (iv) if ordinary WeChat females are more anonymous than ordinary males; (v) if People Nearby females are more anonymous than People Nearby males.

With regard to the former, the authors focus on three factors (perceived value, trust, and perceived risk), and investigate whether and to what extent habit moderates the relationship between SNS-switching intention and actual switching behavior. Design/methodology/approach: Data collection for this study was carried out using an anonymous survey. The questionnaire was devised based on the literature review. It consisted of a total of 34 items, all of which used the seven-point Likert scale, and was divided into nine sections. Data collection lasted for approximately three months from March to May 2015. Data analysis used SPSS and SmartPLS statistical software packages. First, the descriptive statistics were computed. Next, reliability as a measure of internal consistency was calculated. Then, the relations between all factors were explored. Findings: Before they switch, users usually evaluate the perceived values and risks of the SNSs they might join, as well as establish the degrees of trust with respect to those networks. Hence, this study is potentially useful to SNS providers planning their business strategies, and/or seeking to optimize their services based on a detailed understanding of the concerns of users and potential users. Originality/value: This study is of considerable importance to the future development of research on switching intention behavior theory and practice, adding to the body of work on specific frameworks that explain the SNS-switching intention and behavior. The main theoretical implication is that the epistemic value component of the perceived value may not significantly affect switching intentions, at least in the SNS context. In addition, the results regarding the moderating effects of habits are a useful confirmation, in the SNS context, of the findings of a small but important body of prior studies. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,Scopus

This study aimed to assist outreach, prevention, and treatment efforts by elucidating relationships between suicidality and both online and offline help seeking. Method: An anonymous online survey provided data on 713 participants, aged 18-71 years. Measures included an expanded General Help-Seeking Questionnaire and the Suicidal Affect-Behavior-Cognition Scale. Results: General linear modeling results showed that, as predicted, face-to-face help-seeking willingness decreased as risk level increased. However, for emerging adults help-seeking likelihood increased with informal online sources as risk increased, while other online help-seeking attitudes differed little by risk level. Linear regression modeling determined that, for suicidal individuals, willingness to seek help from online mental health professionals and online professional support sites was strongly related (ps < .001). Help seeking from social networking sites and anonymous online forums was also interrelated, but more complex, demonstrating the importance of age and social support factors (ps < .001). Conclusion: These findings show that the Internet has altered the suicide-related help-seeking paradigm. Online help seeking for suicidality was not more popular than face-to-face help seeking, even for emerging adults. However, treatment and prevention professionals have good reasons to increase their online efforts, because that is where some of the highest risk individuals are going for help with their most severe personal problems. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Article,Scopus

Due to the difficulty in tracking and categorising the places that individuals choose to visit, this is largely unexplored. However, the recent popularity of location-based social networks (LBSNs) provides a means to gain new insight into this question through checkins - records that are made by LBSN users of their presence at specific street level locations. A web-based participatory survey was used to collect the personality traits and checkin behaviour of 174 anonymous users, who, through their common check-ins, formed a network with 5373 edges and an approximate edge density of 35%. We assess the degree of overlap in personality traits for users visiting common locations, as detected by user checkins. We find that people with similar high levels of conscientiousness, openness or agreeableness tended to have checked-in locations in common. The findings for extraverts were unexpected in that they did not provide evidence of individuals assorting at the same locations, contrary to predictions. Individuals high in neuroticism were in line with expectations, they did not tend to have locations in common. Unanticipated results concerning disagreeableness are of particular interest and suggest that different venue types and distinctive characteristics may act as attractors for people with particularly selective tendencies.

In the present study, we expected these two facets of narcissism to show different patterns of associations with Internet behaviors and social outcomes. Anonymous, self-report data were collected from N=. 532 late adolescent/young adult participants (mean age = 23.33, 54.9% female). Findings from SEM analyses showed that the links between narcissism and social anxiety/social self-efficacy were partially mediated by preference for online social interactions (POSI); however, the two types of narcissism show distinct links to the two outcomes. Vulnerable narcissism was positively associated with POSI, which indirectly predicted problems for both measures of social relations; in contrast, grandiose narcissism was only directly and positively associated with social self-efficacy and negatively with social anxiety. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus

In this paper, we study the impact of differential behavior of users on performance in typical social network-enabled routing applications. We classify users into either collaborative or rational (probabilistically collaborative) and study the impact of this classification and the associated behavior of users on the performance of such applications, including random walk-based routing, shortest path based routing, breadth-first-search based routing, and Dijkstra routing. By experimenting with real-world social network traces, we make several interesting observations. First, we show that some of the existing social graphs have high routing costs, demonstrating poor structure that prevents their use in such applications. Second, we study the factors that make probabilistically collaborative nodes important for the performance of the routing protocol within the entire network and demonstrate that the importance of these nodes stems from their topological features rather than their percentage of all the nodes within the network. © 2016 KSII.",Article,Scopus

Exploiting these online users as crowd workers is promising yet nontrivial. To efficiently leverage human intelligence or crowd wisdom, we need to address the following issues: 1) how to motivate users to participate and 2) how to discourage malicious behaviors, such as copying answers or making random guesses. Furthermore, as low-quality answers may degrade the accuracy of synthetic results sharply, the last issue is how to weed them out. In this paper, we present MacroWiz, a simple yet effective framework to manage crowd wisdom on MSNs. Given a crowdsourcing task, MacroWiz motivates online users to contribute their knowledge or opinions, and assists the task requester in collecting answers, selecting reliable ones, and making ultimate decisions. The platform consists of two functional units: wisdom collection and answer selection. The former estimates and gathers the minimum number of answers required to satisfy the task requirement conservatively, while the latter analyzes the accuracy, the effectiveness, and the cost of each answer, based on which it selects those with high accuracy and low cost by solving a dual-objective optimization problem. We validate the effectiveness of our platform by using MovieLens data sets, which contain over one million anonymous ratings of movies. The experimental results show that MacroWiz significantly reduces the latency in making decisions and provides high-quality answers with low cost. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,Scopus

Methods: Self-reported egocentric sexual network data from the prior six months were collected from 1,349 community-recruited Black MSM in HPTN 061, a multi-component HIV prevention intervention feasibility study. Sexual network composition, size, and density (extent to which members are having sex with one another) were compared by self-reported HIV serostatus and age of the men. GEE models assessed network and other factors associated with having a Black sex partner, having a partner with at least two age category difference (age difference between participant and partner of at least two age group categories), and having serodiscordant/serostatus unknown unprotected anal/vaginal intercourse (SDUI) in the last six months. Results: Over half had exclusively Black partners in the last six months, 46% had a partner of at least two age category difference, 87% had ≤5 partners. Nearly 90% had sex partners who were also part of their social networks. Among HIV-negative men, not having anonymous/exchange/trade partners and lower density were associated with having a Black partner; larger sexual network size and having non-primary partners were associated with having a partner with at least two age category difference; and having anonymous/exchange/trade partners was associated with SDUI. Among HIV-positive men, not having non-primary partners was associated with having a Black partner; no sexual network characteristics were associated with having a partner with at least two age category difference and SDUI. Conclusions: Black MSM sexual networks were relatively small and often overlapped with the social networks. Sexual risk was associated with having non-primary partners and larger network size.

Voluntary counseling program and anonymous testing were provided to patrons at 1 gay bar, 7 night clubs and 3 gay saunas in Taipei and New Taipei Cities in 2012. HIV-1 subtypes were determined using gag subtype-specific PCR and phylogenetic analysis by env sequences. Recent HIV-1 infection was determined using LAg-Avidity EIA. In-depth interviews and questionnaires were used to identify risk factors. The prevalence and incidence of HIV-1 among MSM in Taiwan were 4.38% (53/1,208) and 3.29 per 100 person-years, respectively. Of 49 cases genotyped, 48 (97.9%) were infected with subtype B and 1 with CRF01-AE (2%). Phylogenetic analysis of 46 HIV-1 strains showed that 25 (54.4%) subtype B strains formed 9 clusters with each other or with other local strains. The CRF01-AE case clustered with a reference strain from a Thai blood donor with bootstrap value of 99. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that risk factors associated with HIV-1 infection included use of oil-based solution as lubricant (vs. saliva or water-based lubricants, OR= 4.23; p <0.001); exclusively receptive role (vs. insertive role, OR=9.69; p <0.001); versatile role (vs. insertive role, OR= 6.45; p= 0.003); oral sex (vs. insertive role, OR= 11.93; p= 0.044); times of sexual contact per week (2-3 vs. zero per week, OR=3.41; p= 0.021); illegal drug use (OR= 4.12; p <0.001); and history of sexually transmitted diseases (OR= 3.65; p= 0.002).

Misuse of oil-based solution as lubricant is a new risk factor identified among MSM in Taiwan.

Systems that allow anonymous communication afford freedom to explore identity and discuss taboo topics, but can result in negative disinhibited behavior such as cyberbullying. Identifiable communication systems allows one to reach a known audience and avoid negative disinhibition, but can constrain behavior with concerns about privacy and reputation. One persistent design issue is understanding how to leverage the benefits of anonymity without suffering its drawbacks. This paper presents a case study analysis of question asking on Facebook confession boards (FCBs), a tool popular on some college campuses. FCBs present a unique configuration in which members of an offline community (e.g., a university) anonymously submit content to a moderator who posts it to a Facebook page where others in the community can view it and respond. Response is via identifiable Facebook comments and likes. Our results show users asking about taboo and stigmatized topics with local others, and receiving relevant responses with little cyberbullying or negativity. © Copyright 2015 ACM.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Some social networks, specifically those that are built on the basis of fairness, cannot incentivize members using tangible things and thus require an intangible way to do so. In such networks, a personalized recommender could provide an incentive for members to interact with other members in the community. Behavior-based trust models that generally compute social trust values using the interactions of a member with other members in the community have proven to be good for this. These models, however, largely ignore the interactions of those members with whom a member has interacted, referred to as ""friendship effects."" Results from social studies and behavioral science show that friends have a significant influence on the behavior of the members in the community. Following the famous Spanish proverb on friendship ""Tell Me Your Friends and I Will Tell You Who You Are,"" we extend our behavior-based trust model by incorporating the ""friendship effect"" with the aim of improving the accuracy of the recommender system. In this article, we describe a trust propagation model based on associations that combines the behavior of both individual members and their friends. The propagation of trust in our model depends on three key factors: the density of interactions, the degree of separation, and the decay of friendship effect. We evaluate our model using a real data set and make observations on what happens in a social network with and without trust propagation to understand the expected impact of trust propagation on the ranking of the members in the recommended list. We present the model and the results of its evaluation. This work is in the context of moderated networks for which participation is by invitation only and in which members are anonymous and do not know each other outside the community. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Article,Scopus

To date, due to barriers in data collection, there has been little research into how our personality relates to the categories of place that we visit. Using the Foursquare LBSN, we have released a web-based participatory application that examines the personality characteristics and checkin behaviour of volunteer Foursquare users. Over a four-month period, we examine the behaviour and the ""Big Five"" personality traits of 174 anonymous users who had collectively checked in 487,396 times at 119,746 venues. Significant correlations are found for Conscientiousness, Openness and Neuroticism. In contrast to some previous findings about online social networks, Conscientiousness is positively correlated with LBSN usage. Openness correlates mainly with location-based variables (average distance between venues visited, venue popularity, number of checkins at sociable venues). For Neuroticism, further negative correlations are found (number of venues visited, number of sociable venues visited). No correlations are found for the other personality traits, which is surprising for Extroversion. The study concludes that personality traits help to explain individual differences in LBSN usage and the type of places visited. © 2015 The Authors.",Article,Scopus

Electronic devices augment our daily lives and the ways we function within them. Distributed sensory networks connect individual data nodes into an interdependent system-organism that monitors its own behaviours as well as its participants. At the same time, individual users and their mobile devices extend these data networks through location-based and personal content to form user-centred data landscapes. Peer-to-peer user-powered networks allow for direct, yet often anonymous communication that leads to new forms of social participation. They provide unique opportunities for creativity and respond to our new expectations of globally connected, locally situated lives. This new urban dimension is enabled by ubiquitous mobile devices. Always connected, context-aware mobile devices serve as gateways into these multimodal data-infused landscapes. Social networks link individual users and form asynchronous spatially discontinuous community that challenges the conventional definition of the public realm. However, in contrast to past media environments, participants in these emerging e-landscapes are both recipients and agents operating within the single media culture-location continuum.

Mathematical models and longitudinal studies of stable couples indicate concurrency plays a critical role in sustaining generalized HIV epidemics in heterosexual populations, and East and Southern African nations identified concurrency reduction as a priority for HIV prevention. ""Know Your Network"" (KYN) is a single-session community-level concurrency awareness intervention designed to address this need. It is rooted in traditional social network research, but takes advantage of new network methodology and years of participatory action research with communities living in a region of Kenya with the highest HIV prevalence nationally. KYN combines didactic presentation, interactive exercises, high-impact graphics, and a network survey with immediate visualization of the results, to prompt a community conversation about sexual norms. We combined focus group discussions and the traditional east African baraza to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of KYN for use with adults living in rural Nyanza Province, Kenya. We were able to implement KYN with fidelity to its components. Participants understood the intervention's messages about concurrency and its role in HIV transmission through sexual networks. They agreed to provide anonymous egocentric data on their sexual partnerships, and in return we successfully simulated a representation of their local network for them to view and discuss. This launched a dynamic conversation about concurrency and sexual norms that persisted after the intervention. The concurrency message was novel, but resonant to participants, who reported sharing it with their children, friends, and sexual partners. With clear evidence of KYN's feasibility and acceptability, it would be appropriate to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention using a community-randomized trial. If effective, KYN would offer an inexpensive complement to ongoing comprehensive HIV prevention efforts in generalized epidemic settings. © 2014 The Authors.",Article,Scopus

We initiated a faculty-facilitated, peer small group course for our third year students, creating virtual classrooms using social networking and online learning management system technologies. The course emphasized narrative self-reflection, group inquiry, and peer support. Methods: We conducted this study to analyze the effects of a professionalism course on third year medical students' empathy and self-reflection (two elements of professionalism) and their perceptions about the course. Students completed the Groningen Reflection Ability Scale (GRAS) and the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) before and after the course and provided anonymous online feedback. Results: The results of the JSE before and after the course demonstrated preservation of empathy rather than its decline. In addition, there was a statistically significant increase in GRAS scores (p < 0.001), suggesting that the sharing of personal narratives may foster reflective ability and reflective practice among third year students.

Recent studies have demonstrated that these new online contacts can be important informational resources, and can even exert significant influence on individuals' behavior in various contexts. However little is known about how people select their health contacts in these virtual domains. This is because selection preferences in peer networks are notoriously difficult to detect. In existing networks, unobserved pressures on tie formation - such as common organizational memberships, introductions to friends of friends, or limitations on accessibility - may mistakenly be interpreted as individual preferences for interacting/not interacting with others. We address these issues by adopting a social media approach to studying network formation. We study social selection using an invivo study within an online exercise program, in which anonymous participants have equal opportunities for initiating relationships with other program members. This design allows us to identify individuals' preferences for health contacts, and to evaluate what these preferences imply for members' access to new kinds of health information, and for the kinds of social influences to which they are exposed. The study was conducted within a goal-oriented fitness competition, in which participation was greatest among a small core of active individuals. Our results show that the active participants displayed indifference to the fitness and exercise profiles of others, disregarding information about others' fitness levels, exercise preferences, and workout experiences, instead selecting partners almost entirely on the basis of similarities on gender, age, and BMI. Interestingly, the findings suggest that rather than expanding and diversifying their sources of health information, participants' choices limited the value of their online resources by selecting contacts based on characteristics that are common sources of homophily in offline relationships. In light of our findings, we discuss design principles that may be useful for organizations and policy makers trying to improve the value of participants' social capital within online health programs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus

It also allows considering the role of the topology of the social network involved may play in the level of cooperation found. The results of this work support the idea that personal trust promotes cooperation beyond the level of general trust. We also found that this effect carries over to the whole group, making it more cohesive, but that higher levels of cohesion rely on a particular topology.

When the behavior occurs in intimate relationships this is called intimate partner violence (IPV). There are many resources available to survivors of IPV in getting out of abusive situations, but the information is not readily available and is not always easy to find. Furthermore, once the survivor has escaped from the abusive situation, there are not many support type resources that are easily accessible, especially to people lacking transportation and to those residing in rural or suburban areas. LEAF is being created to address the issues that arise from limits in physical community support. The acronym stands for lending encouragement, affirming futures. These embody the vision for a system to provide support to those in difficult situations. The system contains three components: a web portal, a privacy-conscious social network, and a mobile app. By providing a web portal, LEAF aims to be a location where abuse survivors and others can find relevant information. The social network provides an online support community unrestricted by geographical diversity. LEAF incorporates new techniques for anonymous communication in social networks to enable information flow over distributed protected content, while safeguarding both personal information and privacy of individuals from unauthorized disclosure.

In this article, we show that this kind of indiscriminate one-to-many (i.e., monologue) communication, in which the diverse interests of recipients are not considered, may induce a tendency toward egocentrism that interferes with other-oriented concerns, resulting in a reduced inclination to display prosocial behavior. In Experiment 1, participants induced to post a public communication subsequently allocated less money to anonymous strangers in the dictator game than did control participants. In Experiment 2, participants directing a post about participation in an experiment to their Facebook friends volunteered to help code fewer data sheets than did controls. Moreover, an egocentric state was shown to mediate the relationship between indiscriminate one-to-many communication and helping behavior. We provide the first demonstration that indiscriminate one-to-many communication on online social networks may be associated with a tendency toward self-interest.

Finally, we find that Anonymous users are generally less inhibited to be active participants, as they tweet more, lurk less, follow more accounts, and are more willing to expose their activity to the general public.

Only five respondents were not interested in following peers, academic staff, clinicians or professional associations on Facebook. Four key themes emerged: peer collaboration, need for separation between personal and professional realms, complimentary learning and enhanced communication. Students wish to make educational connections via SNS, yet expressed a strong desire to maintain privacy, and a distinction between personal and professional lives.

Unfortunately, even when such countermeasures are in place, the OSNs can still infer sensitive information based on the social network structure and the behavior of users. In this paper, we present VirtualFriendShip, a novel solution that allows users to hide their real social network structure, and to browse the OSNs while keeping their actions anonymous. To do so, we introduce the concept of routing friends, which are build upon the social trust and relay other users traffic throughout a decentralized channel. We demonstrate the feasibility of our solution via a prototype implementation of VirtualFriendShip for Facebook. Alongside with a set of experiments we show that the additional costs are tolerable to end users. © 2014 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus

We have developed a system that de-anonymizes anonymous posts on social networks with a considerably high precision rate. We analysed this system and its behaviour and, on the basis of our findings, we clarified a de-anonymization model and used it to clarify the effects of external information on anonymity.

Studying the role of information is relevant as information on other people's actions is often not available for free: a recruiting firm may need to call a job candidate's references, a bank may need to find out about the credit history of a new client, etc. We find that people cooperate almost fully when information on their actions is freely available to their potential partners. Cooperation is less likely, however, if people have to pay about half of what they gain from cooperating with a cooperator.

Recently, an online cognitive-behavioral treatment for female sexual dysfunctions was evaluated. Although significant improvements were observed in sexual functioning, the treatment was primarily a behavioral intervention because of difficulties with engaging participants in cognitive therapy over e-mail. To address this limitation, the use of chat groups was incorporated into a new online treatment for female sexual dysfunctions-the PursuingPleasure program. Thirty-eight women participated in the PursuingPleasure chat groups. The goals of the chat groups were to address and overcome challenges as women progressed through PursuingPleasure and to create a social support network where group therapy processes could be used. The chat groups aimed to address misunderstandings, monitor changes, and receive feedback. A qualitative analysis of the chat groups revealed that they helped to facilitate the cognitive-affective aspects of the program, as well as fulfill their other intended functions. This study demonstrates how the use of chat groups in the online treatment of female sexual dysfunctions is a useful addition to Internet-based treatment. Feedback suggests that the chat groups were one of the most helpful aspects of the program, although a small group of women reported finding the groups unhelpful. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus

In this paper, we study the impact of differential behavior of users on performance in typical social network-based information dissemination applications. We classify users into either collaborative or rational (probabilistically collaborative) and study the impact of this classification and the associated behavior of users on the performance on such applications. By experimenting with real-world social network traces, we make several interesting observations. First, we show that some of the existing social graphs have high routing costs, demonstrating poor structure that prevents their use in such applications. Second, we study the factors that make probabilistically collaborative nodes important for the performance of the routing protocol within the entire network and demonstrate that the importance of these nodes stems from their topological features rather than their percentage of all the nodes within the network. © 2012 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Given recent dramatic increases in HIV and sexually transmitted disease within this community, gaining insight into how sexual networks connect neighborhoods and cities is important for formulating public health interventions. Due to the high degree of similarity exhibited by subsets of Craig list ads, and the presumption that a set of near-identical ads, when not spam, originate from the same author, we can apply techniques for efficient near-duplicate detection to identify clusters of near-identical ads. By examining each of these clusters and identifying differences in user-supplied location tags, we can then reconstruct an approximation of an anonymous individual's movement footprint over time, as well as estimate the rate at which ad authors seek sexual encounters. For the state of California, we find that 86% of all encounter requests for a given set occur within a 50 mile area, with only less that 4% of messages reflecting long-distance travel over 250 miles. 60% of all detected clusters reposted ads within 2 weeks of the first detected post.

Its simplicity makes it an attractive model to explain the evolution of reciprocal altruism in animals that lack the information or cognitive skills needed for other types of reciprocity. Yet, generalized reciprocity is anonymous and thus defenseless against exploitation by defectors. Recognizing that animals hardly ever interact randomly, we investigate whether social network structure can mitigate this vulnerability. Our results show that heterogeneous interaction patterns strongly support the evolution of generalized reciprocity. The future probability of being rewarded for an altruistic act is inversely proportional to the average connectivity of the social network when cooperators are rare. Accordingly, sparse networks are conducive to the invasion of reciprocal altruism. Moreover, the evolutionary stability of cooperation is enhanced by a modular network structure. Communities of reciprocal altruists are protected against exploitation, because modularity increases the mean access time, that is, the average number of steps that it takes for a random walk on the network to reach a defector.

Users are given the freedom to fail to respond to some of these requests, or can choose to submit fake identity properties, so as to reduce the risk of identification, surveillance or observation of any kind. However, this freedom has led to serious security and privacy incidents [23], due to the role users'identities play in establishing social and privacy settings. In this paper, we take a step toward addressing this open problem, by analyzing the dynamics of social identity verification protocols. We use a game theoretical framework to describe a simple two-player general sum game describing the behavior of a server system (like Facebook) that provides utility to users. Users can choose to register a new identity using the true information, false information or no information (and remain anonymous). Likewise, the server may choose to believe and add the prospective social user, believe and yet fail the registration, or do nothing. We show criteria on the relative payoff of providing no information (anonymity) that produce various Nash equilibria. We then show that in the presence of a binding agreement to cooperate, most players will agree to share information. This result is consistent with reality, and suggests that sites that require users to authenticate with identity information should be prepared to provide strong guarantees on privacy in order to ensure that a social contract is maintained and the sites are not damaged.

We then assessed whether mimetic mechanisms or the existence of a leader were underlying conditions for the joining process by testing 5 computer models relying respectively on 5 hypotheses: the independence of individuals, an anonymous mimetism, a mimetism according to kinship, a mimetism according to affiliation, and eventually the existence of a leader. We found that departure latencies, associations, and the order of individuals at departure time could all be explained by the mimetism according to affiliation model. Thus, an individual's decision to join the collective movement or not depended on the decision taken by its preferred social partners. These results show the importance of social parameters in primate decision making and that the high cohesion displayed by the group members might not be constrained merely by ecological factors such as predation or foraging consideration. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Article,Scopus

This inevitably leads to the problem of being able to choose the right one which is mostly done today by trial-and-error. However this gets tricky if it involves sharing privacy sensitive information with the service e.g. in the case of health and well-ness services. A customer's trust in a new online service is known to increase based on testimonials (or observable behavior) of people within a social distance (friends, friends-of-friends etc). Linking testimonials to users requires releasing one's social network information which by itself is privacy invasive. The paper presents the concept of an anonymous social stamp which can be assigned to anonymous statements and help prove that the statement was made by a particular member of an external social networking site. Trust can then be derived based on the social distance between the persons concerned: the person who made the statement and the person verifying the statement. A possible implementation of the concept is shown with the existing infrastructure of RSA keys already in use by social networking sites. The concept is applicable for the new services that can create confidence in new users by revealing anonymous data sharing configurations of other users with the service.",Conference Paper,Scopus

In particular, it has been suggested that interaction in virtual communities erodes elements of responsibility, accountability and social trust that build traditionally meaningful communities. The purpose of this study was to investigate how undergraduate medical students use the social network website Facebook, and to identify any unprofessional behaviour displayed online. Methods: A voluntary anonymous online survey was devised by the University of Liverpool, and emailed to students. Question topics included the use of Facebook, privacy settings, groups relating to the course and professional behaviours. Results were input to spss for analysis. Results: The response rate was 31 per cent (n = 56). The majority of respondents did have a Facebook account and admitted there were photos they found embarrassing on the site. Over half of the respondents reported they had seen unprofessional behaviour by their colleagues on Facebook. Although students say that they are aware of the UK's General Medical Council (GMC) guidance, unprofessional behaviour is still demonstrated on the site. Discussion: This research highlights the issue of social networking websites and professionalism amongst medical students. Further guidance from the GMC and medical schools should remind students that images and information placed on social networking sites is in the public domain, and could impact upon their professional reputation and identity. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2010.",Article,Scopus

We find that inter-city communications can be characterized by a gravity model: the intensity of communication between two cities is proportional to the product of the two populations divided by the square of the distance between the cities. Furthermore, we observe that intra-urban communications scale superlinearly with city population. © 2009 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Nowadays, various kinds of interpersonal human interactions, from mobile calls to emails, provide particular avenues to explore the inherent properties of communication patterns. In this article, we present a comprehensive study on a massive anonymous call records obtained from a major mobile service operator. The important difference laid in our work and previous mainly topological analyses is that we report on multiple aspects of the dataset. By investigating the calls of the users, we find out that most calls tend to last within one minute. Call duration between two females is much longer than that of two males. But calls of males generally involve more stations than that of female, indicating a larger mobile range of the males. We also observed that people tend to communicate more with each other when they share similar characters. Besides, the network is well-connected and robust to random attack. We also demonstrate that the close-knit sub-groups with little discrepancy in the characteristics of its involved users usually evoke more calls. Another interesting discovery is that call behaviors among people between workdays and weekends is obviously distinct. Generally speaking, the goal that we research on call network through multidimensional analyses is to uncover the intricate patterns of human communications and put up reasonable insights into future service intelligence. © Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.",Article,Scopus

This density of social connectedness tends to militate against the boundaries normally associated with professionalised forms of care. This article explores how these tensions are negotiated by people who have developed local counselling services in two rural areas in Scotland. Counselling is becoming increasingly widely used as a response to a variety of forms of distress and is argued to constitute a modern urban and feminised form of care. However, notwithstanding its urban origins and associations, people in some rural places in Scotland have successfully arranged for training to be delivered locally to men as well as women. Nevertheless they recognise that for many rural residents, counselling continues to be alien and viewed with suspicion. They describe how they protect the identities of service-users using locational and social network strategies. They also discuss the issues that flow from the challenges of providing well-boundaried relationships. In so doing they point to an inverse relationship between social proximity and trust, thereby supplementing existing accounts of the disadvantages of social proximity in rural places.",Article,Scopus

Such programs will have significant implications for developing improved stepped models of care. This article describes various e-health programs and lessons learned related to access, promotion, user demographics, and patterns of use. In addition, validation procedures, effectiveness and attrition rates, fitting and tailoring, and qualitative analyses of social networks are described. It is difficult to validate e-health programs that are completely anonymous and do not require registration, personal interaction, or membership fees. As competition emerges in the budding e-health industry, best practice guidelines will need to be developed for collecting data and evaluating the utility of these programs.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Current anonymous routing protocols provide anonymity by forwarding traffic through a static path of randomly selected relay nodes. In practice, however, malicious relays can perform passive logging attacks to compromise the anonymity of a flow. This degradation is accelerated when nodes fail, forcing source node to reconstruct a path, and in doing so, leaking more information to passive loggers. This ""predecessor attack"" is highly effective and difficult to defend against on current systems. In this paper, we propose a highly effective approach to blocking predecessor attacks by leveraging trusted links from social networks. We first show how users can completely shield themselves from traditional logging attacks. We then propose a hybrid logging attack optimized for social networks, and perform detailed analysis to show that we can defend against it using optimized path selection techniques. Finally, we analyze detailed measurement traces from Facebook to show that our approach is indeed feasible given the user behavior in social networks today. ©2008 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Smaller social networks predicted heavier alcohol use over time which, in turn, predicted attrition of abstinence supporters and decreased multiplexity of relationships. More frequent social contact predicted improved Expanded Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) symptoms. Improved BPRS symptoms and greater multiplexity of social relationships predicted each other over time. More severe BPRS symptoms and attrition of abstinence supporters predicted each other, but the mechanisms of this relationship and possible associations with alcohol or drug use remain to be tested. More severe BPRS symptoms also predicted later, proportional loss of professional contacts.
