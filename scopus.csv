Specifically, the effects of organizations’ symmetrical communication and organization-employee relationship (OER) on individuals’ social media usage motives (e.g., vent negative feelings, warn others) and negative behavioral intentions are examined. Results of an online survey of full-time employees in the United States show that the effects of OER on employees’ negative communication behavior intentions are mediated by their social media motives. Symmetrical communication had a large positive effect on OER, which in turn decreased their motives to share negative contents on anonymous social media. Theoretical and practical implications for public relations and employee behaviors are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Article,Scopus

Within the options for increasing learners’ interaction in MOOCs, it is possible to integrate (third-party) external tools as part of the instructional design of the courses. In MOOCs on computer sciences, there are, for example, web-based Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) which can be integrated and that allow learners to do programming tasks directly in their browsers without installing desktop software. This work focuses on analyzing the effect on learners’ engagement and behavior of integrating a third-party web-based IDE, Codeboard, in three MOOCs on Java programming with the purpose of promoting learning-by-doing (learning by coding in this case). In order to measure learners’ level of engagement and behavior, data was collected from Codeboard on the number of compilations, executions and code generated, and compared between learners who registered in Codeboard to save and keep a record of their projects (registered learners) and learners who did not register in Codeboard and did not have access to these extra features (anonymous learners). The results show that learners who registered in Codeboard were more engaged than learners who did not register (in terms of number of compilations and executions), spent more time coding and did more changes in the base code provided by the teachers. The main implication of this study suggests the need for a trade-off between designing MOOCs that allow a very easy and anonymous access to external tools aimed for a more active learning, and forcing learners to give a step forward in terms of commitment in exchange for benefitting from additional features of the external tool used. © 2020, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.",Article,Scopus

We aimed to identify the attitudes of Tunisian early career psychiatrists towards the older adults. This was a cross-sectional study conducted among 71 early career psychiatrists. Data were collected through anonymous online surveys. A series of 4 point Likert-type questions (""strongly agree"", ""somewhat agree"", ""somewhat disagree"", ""strongly disagree"") asked participants about their beliefs about older patients, the characteristics of the psychiatric care of an older person and emotions related to caring for older patients. Psychiatrists agreed that the older patient: is frail and vulnerable in 64.8% of cases, does not trust his psychiatrist in 28% of cases, has problems of communication in 36.6% of the cases and shows hostile or aggressive behavior in 5.6% of the cases. A multivariate binary logistic regression analysis found that clinical experience would play an independent role in predicting the following beliefs and attitudes of early career psychiatrists towards older patients: the belief that the older patient often has perceptual disorders that he is fragile and vulnerable, that he often requires polypharmacy, and that his management exposes the psychiatrist to painful emotional experiences. Given the population aging, early career psychiatrists need to be equipped with skills to fulfil significant roles in responding to future health and support needs. Integrating clinical training in psychogeriatrics into the psychiatric curriculum is strongly recommended. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,Scopus

However, contemporary patterns of family life suggest that this may be a significant experience for many. This exploratory study employed an anonymous online survey, conducted April–November 2017, to collect data about specific issues (experiences, challenges and satisfactions) faced by carers living at a distance requiring at least 1 hr travel time (each way) from the person they support. One hundred and twenty-eight participant responses were analysed. Qualitative (thematic) analysis identified that ‘distance carers’ carry out multiple care tasks, both when with, and apart from, the person they care for. Distance creates specific challenges for carers who have to work to ‘bridge the distance gap’ and who cannot ‘just drop in’ and see the person they support. Distance further exposes carers to emotional, financial and temporal demands. The use of technologies or the availability of a wider support network may support distance carers, and some explore the viability of relocation. However, these potential support strategies were identified as ‘fragile’ and at risk of breaking down. Despite the challenges identified, distance carers also reported satisfactions derived from supporting their relative/friend. While the numbers of those providing distance care are unknown, this research suggests that this is a significant carer group, whose needs should be recognised in health and social care policy, practice and research. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Article,Scopus

In a Finnish online image-board, socially withdrawn individuals anonymously take part in conversations concerning, for example, welfare and the difficulties of working life. The aim of this study is to bring new perspectives to the discussion about anonymous online communication, and especially its relationship with social exclusion and anti-social behaviour. In the article, I examine how ‘the anti-social’ is produced and understood in this anonymously used forum. Through a thematically constructed textual analysis of online discussions, the following questions are answered: What kinds of life-political themes are found in the discussion concerning social withdrawal? How is the feeling of being an outsider in one’s own society voiced in this online community? What kind of space for public discussion does this specific forum provide? In the online space, an intimate public is formed around shared narratives and the conversations seem to offer at least a space of expressive politics and social criticism for the participants in a situation that is labelled by precariousness. © The Author(s) 2018.",Article,Scopus

As a result, aside from conventional social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, platform designers introduced many alternative social media platforms (e.g., 4chan, Whisper, Snapchat, Mastodon) to serve specific userbases. Among these platforms, anonymous social media sites like Whisper and 4chan hold a special place for researchers. Unlike conventional social media sites, posts on anonymous social media sites are not associated with persistent user identities or profiles. Thus, these anonymous social media sites can provide an extremely interesting data-driven lens into the effects of anonymity on online user behavior. However, to the best of our knowledge, currently there are no publicly available datasets to facilitate research efforts on these anonymity effects. To that end, in this paper, we aim to publicly release the first ever large-scale dataset from Whisper, a large anonymous online social media platform. Specifically, our dataset contains 89.8 Million Whisper posts (called ""whispers"") published between a 2-year period from June 6, 2014 to June 6, 2016 (when Whisper was quite popular). Each of these whispers contained both post text and associated metadata. The metadata contains information like coarse-grained location of upload and categories of whispers. We also present preliminary descriptive statistics to demonstrate a significant language and categorical diversity in our dataset. We leverage previous work as well as novel analysis to demonstrate that the whispers contain personal emotions and opinions (likely facilitated by a disinhibition complex due to anonymity). Consequently, we envision that our dataset will facilitate novel research ranging from understanding online aggression to detect depression within online populace. © 2020 ACM.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine 1) if use of wearables was associated with exercise dependence and 2) prevalence of compensatory behaviors (CB) in response to not meeting goals set within the wearable. Methods: University students completed an anonymous online survey with the Exercise Dependence Scale-21. Participants also provided information about wearable use and CB (e.g. restricting food) in response to not meeting fitness goals. Multiple linear regression assessed the association between wearable use, CB, and exercise dependence. Results: Majority of participants using wearables reported CB if they did not meet goals set by wearables. Using wearables and engagement in CB were associated with higher exercise dependence scores. Discussion: This study suggests that wearables may exacerbate harmful compulsions, like exercise dependence, and should be recommended with caution by health education specialists. Translation to Health Education Practice: Consequences of wearable use are important to consider in the development of health education materials and interventions promoting wearable use. Certified Health Education Specialists should consider how to address negative aspects of fitness technology in physical activity promotion. © 2020, © 2020 SHAPE America.",Article,Scopus

Most research to date has only explored global (versus context-specific) drinking norms as they relate to general drinking behavior. To better understand risky drinking behavior in students, how norms may vary across drinking environments should be considered. Objectives: We sought to explore differences in drinking norms (descriptive and injunctive), personal approval, and alcohol use across specific drinking locations and how these location-specific predictors combine to best predict alcohol consumption in home/dorm locations, bars, and parties. Methods: College student drinkers (N = 115, 76% female) participated in an anonymous online cross-sectional survey in 2015–2016 assessing personal and perceived drinking experiences and attitudes across various locations. Results: Alcohol use, descriptive norms of alcohol use, and injunctive norms of alcohol use (but not personal approval) varied across location. In addition, location-specific descriptive norms were associated with alcohol use in each drinking location, whereas location specific personal approval was associated with alcohol use only at home/dorm and bar locations. Furthermore, descriptive norms and personal approval of drinking in a given location predicted alcohol use in that same location, while norms or approval for other locations did not. Conclusion/Importance: Results highlight the importance of specificity of perceived drinking norms and personal approval for predicting location-specific alcohol use. These findings have implications for interventions, which may benefit from discussions of students’ preferred drinking locations and providing location-specific normative feedback. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus

However, the empirical study of values-consistent living has been limited by significant heterogeneity in measurement due to the absence of a ‘gold-standard’ assessment tool. The Valuing Questionnaire (VQ), a 10-item self-report measure that taps progress in and obstruction of values-consistent living, is well suited for use in research and clinical settings, yet its psychometric properties have been limitedly examined despite its frequent use. The current study utilized data from an anonymous online survey to evaluate the factor structure and psychometric properties of the VQ in adults (n = 252) with a self-reported history of cardiovascular disease or elevated disease risk. Results from a confirmatory factor analyses provided support for the two-factor structure, reflecting progress towards values and obstruction of valued living. Additionally, the VQ factor scores evidenced internal consistency, convergent, concurrent, and incremental predictive validity. VQ factors scores also evidenced known groups validity, distinguishing between those with/without psychological distress.

However, the effects of identity disclosure on users’ content-generation behaviors are not well examined. In this study, we address this critical issue by using a natural experiment—a large corporate online community chose to disclose users’ identities in one section (the focal section) but not the other (the neighbor section). Our results show that in the focal section, disclosing identity increases social presence and inhibits users’ willingness to generate content, resulting in greater effort spent per content but smaller content volume. Surprisingly, we find that users significantly change their content-generation behaviors in the neighbor section, where users remain anonymous. Specifically, identity disclosure has a strong displacement effect: the low-effort content, which is deterred by identity disclosure in the focal section, will be reallocated to the anonymous neighbor section. Furthermore, taking both sections together, we find that the content volume increases and content effort exerted on each content decreases overall. These findings demonstrate that identity disclosure is a double-edged sword with regard to user content generation. On the one hand, disclosure motivates users’ effort on each content in the focal section. On the other hand, the displacement effect meant that this benefit comes at the cost of reducing users’ effort per content in the neighbor section. Copyright: © 2020 INFORMS.",Article,Scopus

Data were collected via an anonymous online questionnaire administered to 338 active duty male soldiers between the ages of 18 and 24 at an Army post in the mid-South region of the United States. Analyses examined the extent soldiers accurately perceived the collective norms of their peers. Men were inaccurate in their estimation of the extent to which other male soldiers followed principles of consent in their sexual behaviors, such as stopping the first time a woman says “no” to sexual activity, stopping sexual activity even if aroused, and garnering a verbal affirmation for sex. Soldiers were inaccurate in their perception of peer norms regarding indicators of sexual interest and consent, including the belief that when a woman lets a man kiss her she wants to have sex, and if a woman wears a sexy dress she’s asking for sex. Soldiers were also inaccurate in their estimations of other male soldier’s comfort with sexism including feeling uncomfortable with sexist comments or sexual jokes that put down women. In addition, soldiers underestimated men’s preference for a good relationship with one woman rather than many sexual partners and overestimated their peers’ use of dating sites to locate sexual partners.

Specifically, this study explores the antecedents of employees' positive and negative company-related information-sharing intentions on two distinctive social media platforms, personal (e.g. Facebook) and anonymous social networking sites (e.g. Glassdoor). Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was conducted with 419 full-time employees in the United States from various industry sectors. Findings: Individual (enjoyment, venting negative feelings, and self-enhancement), interpersonal (bonding and bridging ties), and organizational (organization–employee relationship and perceived external prestige) factors are considerably and distinctly associated with employees' behavioral intentions on different social media platforms. Originality/value: This study is among the first to understand employees' communicative behaviors on social media (sECB) by linking diverse levels of motivational factors: individual, interpersonal, and organizational using a theoretical framework of socioecological model (SEM). This study also provides significant practical guidelines for organizational leaders and platform operators by explicating the dynamics of employee motives in engaging in a variety of social media platforms. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,Scopus

Many factors (e.g., driving experience, aggression) contribute to the increased risk, but factors associated with daytime sleepiness and sleep health may also contribute. The current study examined the relationships between experiences of sleepiness, sleep timing and stability, sleep-impaired emotional regulation, and sleep-impaired cognition among younger persons engaging in 2 risky sleepy driving behaviors: Continuing to drive while sleepy and having experienced a sleep-related close call. Method: The study was advertised in the Queensland University of Technology's online environment and 137 young adults (58.39% women) aged 18 to 25 years completed an anonymous online questionnaire assessing aspects related to daytime sleepiness, sleep timing and stability, sleep-impaired emotional regulation, and sleep-impaired cognition. Results: In total, 15.38% of the participants reported that they had experienced a sleep-related close call. The main outcomes were that both age and the sleep-impaired emotional regulation variable were associated with the outcome variables. The study variables accounted for 18.94% of the variance in continuing to drive while sleepy, and the same variables accounted for 42.69% of the variance (Nagelkerke’s R2 statistic) in having had a sleep-related close call. Shorter sleep durations and greater levels of sleep-impaired cognition were significantly associated with having a sleep-related close call. Conclusion: Different variables were associated with the 2 risky driving behaviors, suggesting different underlying factors. Sleep-impaired emotional regulation and/or sleep-impaired cognition could be used to signal drivers that they are impaired by sleepiness. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus

To identify current preceptor orientation and development programs at US colleges and schools of pharmacy and propose future initiatives for preceptor programs. Methods. An anonymous 28-item survey was administered in January 2017 to 128 experiential education personnel at accredited US schools and colleges of pharmacy. Data from completed survey instruments were tabulated and qualitative responses to open-ended questions were examined using thematic analysis. Results. Eighty-five experiential education administrators participated in the survey (response rate567%). Most preceptor orientation programs met the majority of requirements as outlined within the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education’s Standard 20.3, although only 42% of programs mandated preceptor orientation prior to student placement. Two-thirds of respondents offered annual, live preceptor develop-ment, and 75% of programs used commercially available online products. Nearly 40% of respondents collaborated with other schools or professional organizations to offer preceptor training. Only 29% of programs had specific requirements for pharmacists to maintain their active preceptor status. Seventy percent of respondents reported spending over $2500 and 39% over $5000 annually on preceptor devel-opment. Programs with the highest monetary investment (.$10,000/year) in preceptor development offered multiple venues (live and online) for preceptor training. Programs with significant personnel commitment ($0.5 FTE devoted to preceptor development) frequently had dedicated site visitors. Conclusion. Preceptor orientation programs at US schools of pharmacy are generally similar, but development programs vary significantly across the Academy. Highly invested programs featured live and online training or site visitors who provided individualized feedback or training. Future studies should explore the cost-effectiveness of program options and their impact on preceptor learning and behaviors. © 2020 American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy.",Article,Scopus

The study aims at investigating Malaysian Secondary school students’ awareness of the risks and dangers of SN. A quantitative approach involving a questionnaire survey was used to collect data. The questionnaire was designed to elicit information from the students regarding their awareness of the risks and dangers as well as abuse of the SN systems such as cyberbullying, harassment, sexting etc. The questionnaire was distributed to all available Form Four students from four selected schools in the Klang Valley and Selangor i.e. an urban school, a suburban school, a rural school and an elite school. The quantitative study was conducted on 562 students from the four schools. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used in analysing the data. The findings revealed that there was no rural-urban divide with regard to awareness of the risks and dangers involved in SN. Students in general seemed to be aware of the risks and dangers of SN. Likewise, there was no clear rural-urban divide regarding awareness of privacy issues. However, there was some ignorance regarding certain risks.

The aim of this study is to investigate the behaviour of Greek dental students on Facebook, focusing on potentially unprofessional posts and the online student-patient relationship. Materials and methods: Five hundred and twelve dental students in Greece answered an anonymous, 23-item questionnaire including multiple-choice questions about various topics, including Facebook profile settings and content shared by dental students, student-patient relationship via Facebook; and students' perception about the impact of their online behaviour. Results: 93.2% of responders had a Facebook profile and 80.5% admitted that their online attitude might affect patients' opinion about dental profession. However, 71.7% posted pictures from holidays, 41.5% from nightclubs, and 26.2% photographs wearing swimwear/underwear, while 12.8% expressed online political party predilection. One quarter of students in clinical years were Facebook friends with patients and 58% and 30% of them had online discussion about topics related or not to dentistry, respectively, while 6.8% of dental students had posted defamatory comments about the dental school, faculty members or academic staff on Facebook. Discussion: In accordance with studies in other countries, most Greek dental students had a Facebook profile and, although the majority realised the impact of Facebook behaviour on e-professionalism, a considerable percentage posted unprofessional content. Conclusion: Dental students might fall into pitfalls when it comes to e-professionalism. As social media are becoming an integral part of life, there is need to include e-professionalism in dental education curriculum. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

This netnographic study locates mother perspectives online to explore whether participation in mother-focused forums affords maternal cyber-agency in the homework debate. Findings suggest that many women, positioning themselves as ‘good’ mothers, perform their maternal identity online by upholding an ideology of good mothering which expects maternal support for homework. Alternative homework practices are critiqued as ‘bad’ mothering. Although other perspectives emerge, individual mothers’ abilities to create new homework narratives in anonymous online spaces are restricted by the forums’ alignment towards dominant mothering ideologies and their normative practices. These findings question assumptions of maternal empowerment, support and cyber-agency, in online spaces which operate as communities of collective, hegemonic knowledge. Teachers also infiltrate the forums, directing maternal homework behaviours using good mothering. Good mothering’s impact on maternal cyber-agency and forum homework discussion is therefore highlighted. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,Scopus

The use of these puzzles as a form of remote active learning was fortuitously evaluated immediately prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic based on students' online study behavior patterns, which captured some fascinating data on the frequency and timing of student online viewings. Students' anonymous feedback responses were also evaluated. Across 24 individual crossword postings, student-tracking data showed a total of 17,717 views; equivalent to approximately three views per posting by each student across the two different year groups, with evidence of some similarities and differences to student study habits when forced to work remotely. Furthermore, questionnaire feedback showed that around 80% of second-year students found the crosswords helpful and would welcome more, yet just over 50% of first-year students held these views, illustrating some year group differences. Interestingly, all students had similar opinions regarding their preferred online delivery resources should COVID-19 continue to prevent on-campus teaching. In short, chemistry-themed online crossword puzzles were well-received when incorporated immediately prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. As many teaching institutions move away from a campus-based delivery, these effective and easy to prepare crossword revision aids should be considered by instructors alongside other online resources as they plan their teaching amidst continuing uncertainty.

Building on existing understanding of problematic phone use, this study examined narcissism subtypes as predictors of phubbing behavior. Participants (n = 250 smartphone users) completed an anonymous online study where they reported their phubbing behaviors and completed measures of vulnerable narcissism, grandiose narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism. Analysis was via multiple regression, with vulnerable and grandiose narcissism as predictors; psychopathy and Machiavellianism were also included to account for shared variance with grandiose narcissism. As hypothesized, vulnerable narcissism emerged as a significant predictor in the model, such that higher levels of vulnerable narcissism were associated with more phubbing. In light of previously established negative social outcomes associated with phubbing behaviors, we conclude that although phubbing might help those high in vulnerable narcissism to manage their need for admiration and their contingent self-worth, phubbing may be particularly problematic for these individuals. © The Author(s) 2020.",Article,Scopus

Respondents were 237 adolescents (aged from 14 to 19; 58.2% female), recruited from three Italian high schools, who were asked to fill in a self-report and anonymous online questionnaire investigating their values and gambling behaviors. Specifically, the Portrait Values Questionnaire and the South Oaks Gambling Screen: Revised for Adolescents were used. Results showed that males were keener to adopt more frequently gambling behaviors, this also being more problematic, compared to their female counterparts. Despite conservation and openness to change values seem not to influence gambling behaviors, self-transcendence and self-enhancement values respectively negatively and positively predict gambling problems. More interestingly, self-transcendence values seem to work better as protective factors toward the severity of this risk behavior especially for the male subsample.

This study develops a two-stage conceptual model for the interpretation of individual learning, and aims to explore how individual’s prior experience affects the initiating of subsequent learning behavior first and then impacts the success of subsequent learning behavior. Using a large sample of loan application data over a five-year period from a Chinese P2P lending platform Renrendai, we found strong evidence that both prior successes and prior failures can motivate borrowers to take subsequent borrowing behaviors again. However, in regard to the impact of individual experience on learning outcome, our finding in online environment is contrary to the prevalent view in organizational learning—“we learn more effectively in failure than in success”. Specifically, we found only successes can lead to desirable success whereas failures can’t, which indicates that borrowers with failure experience are willing to repeat borrowing but unable to learn from their failures. Further, we find a beneficial interaction effect between borrower’s prior successes and prior failures on subsequent borrowing success. These results are robust across a variety of settings. Our study enriches the understanding of individual learning by focusing not only on outcome improvement but also on conditioning. Moreover, we investigate learning process in an online environment which is anonymous and lack of peer communication that offline organizations have, we draw some different findings.

Because intimate partner cyber aggression victimization (C-IPV) has received less research attention than IP-IPV, it is important to learn whether such victimization experiences are similar to in-person victimization experiences in terms of their associations with maladaptive functioning or whether they comprise a unique form of IPV. The study also explores strain as a potential mediator of the link between IPV victimization and maladaptive behavior. A sample of undergraduate students aged 18-25 who were in intimate relationships during the past year participated in a voluntary and anonymous online survey (n = 540). Results signaled that C-IPV and IP-IPV shared similar correlates (e.g. depression, substance use, and antisocial behavior) and C-IPV was linked with more forms of maladaptive behavior than certain types of in-person IPV victimization (e.g., sexual and physical) experiences. Results indicated partial support for the predicted mediation. Males were also at higher risk for engaging in substance use and antisocial behavior across all models. The study suggests that harmful electronic exchanges may have adverse consequences for young adults. As such, services providers and educators addressing the issue of IPV should tailor prevention and intervention strategies in a way that is inclusive of cyber aggression and considers it a public health concern. © 2007-2020 Cyberpsychology:.",Article,Scopus

In four studies, we expand on this work to explore whether people are more inclined to lie to impress a potential partner following sexual priming. In all studies, participants were exposed to sexual stimuli (versus non-sexual stimuli) and then interacted with an opposite-sex stranger. In Study 1, unacquainted participants resolved a dilemma while each represented opposing positions. In Study 2, participants rated their preferences, and after viewing a confederate's preferences, re-rated them in a profile shown to the confederate. In Studies 3 and 4, participants reported their number of lifetime sexual partners in anonymous questionnaires and during a chat (Study 3) or while completing an online profile (Study 4). Results indicated that following sexual priming, participants were more likely to conform to the stranger's views (Studies 1 and 2) and reported fewer sexual partners during actual and potential online interactions than in the questionnaires (Study 3). Although the results of Study 4 did not replicate the findings of Study 3, they were directionally consistent with them. Overall, the findings suggest that sexual priming motivates impression management even when it involves lying. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Article,Scopus

The current study aimed to investigate the differences between help-seeking intentions and predictors between different locations across Australia to better understand the barriers to seeking help for rural residents. Methods: An anonymous online survey measuring attitudes, stoicism, help-seeking intentions and demographics was conducted through various channels across Australia. Differences between locations and relationships between variables of interest were analysed using multiple regression and mediation analysis. Results: In total, 471 participants were included in the analysis, the majority residing in outer regional areas (37.4%), followed by inner regional areas (29.9%), major cities (18.3%), remote areas (12.3%) and very remote areas (2.1%). Location, along with attitudes and stoicism, were predictors of help-seeking. A novel mediation model revealed that attitudes partially mediated the association between stoicism and lower help-seeking intentions for both rural and urban participants. Conclusion: Findings from this study extend knowledge of what differentiates people who are willing from those who are not willing to seek help for a mental health concern or suicidal ideation, by their living location. The findings also suggest practical implications for clinical intervention and community prevention that could assist improving help-seeking for rural Australians in the future. © 2020.",Article,Scopus

This research explores the positive and negative aspects of care-giving, including the experience of abuse within the caring relationship, through an anonymous online survey of the mental health, well-being and caring experience of Australian family carers (N = 305). The voluntary participants were recruited through local and national carer associations. Over 40% of respondents reported having experienced abuse by the person they cared for, with the most common form of abuse being verbal abuse (35% of the respondents reporting abuse) and physical abuse (14%). The experience of abuse was related to poorer mental health as measured by the DASS-21 and a lower reported quality of life. Financial stress, lack of support and the negative impacts of care-giving were also significantly associated with mental health and well-being outcomes. The current research is among the first to directly assess the experience of abuse within a broad sample of caregivers, identifying this as a significant issue for caregivers. The findings have clear implications for programs and policies that protect the rights, safety and well-being of caregivers. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Article,Scopus

While a substantial body of research about children's voices in statutory or out-of-home care now exists, there remains a paucity of research into children's voices in family support services delivered by nongovernment organizations. This is despite the primary service purpose being to benefit children. This lack of focus in family support was identified as a research priority by a nongovernment organization in Queensland, Australia, which lead to a collaborative research programme. This article reports on initial research from a survey study to describe the current state of play from practitioners into their perceptions and practices of children's participation in family support contexts. A voluntary and anonymous online, qualitative-predominate survey was opened to 110 practitioners in family support services, of which 50% responded. The findings identified that children's voices were compromised by perceptions of children's capacity relating to age and vulnerability, the parental focus of the service coupled with perceptions of parent's needs and gatekeeping behaviours and service pressures that work against the conditions required for children's rights to voice. © 2020 The Authors.

Qualitative research has identified that parents use a wide range of strategies to provide support. However, parents report being unsure which strategies are likely to be helpful, so often struggle in this role. Presently, little empirical evidence exists to assist parents to decide which strategies are likely to be most helpful. This study aimed to explore the parent-perceived helpfulness of parental strategies to support young people living with mental health problems. Data were collected from February to July of 2018, using a cross-sectional, online, anonymous, self-report survey of participants who identified as parenting a young person (15–24 years) diagnosed with a mental health problem (n = 70). Overall, the strategies perceived as most helpful were practical assistance and personal interactions aimed at promoting positive thoughts and feelings and obtaining appropriate treatment. Least helpful strategies tended to be control-type strategies, aimed at behaviour change. Overall, there was good alignment between strategies’ helpfulness and frequency of use, however, there were exceptions. These exceptions are likely reflections of the specific context of particular situations as well as parental uncertainty regarding alternative strategies. Generally, perceptions of strategies’ helpfulness were unrelated to parent or child characteristics. However, helpfulness of strategies was associated with parents’ satisfaction with their relationship with the young person. Parents’ collective experience-based perceptions about the helpfulness of strategies used to support young people experiencing mental health problems can be harnessed to inform mental health practitioners’ advice to parents and contribute to better mental health outcomes for young people. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Article,Scopus

In the era of the internet, individuals often make payments through various financial platforms such as mobile payments, bank's online interfaces, etc. This paper presents an analysis of a large person-to-person (P2P) financial transactional network of three Baltic countries, namely Estonia, Latvia and, Lithuania. We collaborated with one of the largest financial institutions operating in these three countries to analyse an anonymous dataset of more than two million customers. We modeled these transactions from network science and explored the data with four different objectives. The first objective was to explore the network of transactions from a structural perspective and interpret their meanings. The next two objectives included the attributes of the nodes. In the second objective, we analysed the network for the similarity of interacting nodes in terms of income level. In the third objective, we analysed the spending pattern similarity among the interacting customers. The fourth objective aimed at exploring the relation between income and spending patterns. Our results indicate that the online payment network of Estonia is the most intact, among all the three countries, confirming the slogan of e-Estonia and Lithuanian network being the most fragmented. In addition, Latvia and Lithuania are more similar to each other in terms of their income vs. similarity patterns compared to Estonia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that has studied such a large P2P financial network across three countries and the results of this study can provide insight into the financial behavior of the three Baltic countries. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus

This type of research falls into the emerging field of learning analytics. However, learning analytics research tends to ignore the issue of the reliability of results that are based on MOOCs data, which is typically noisy and generated by a largely anonymous crowd of learners. This paper provides evidence that learning analytics in MOOCs can be significantly biased by users who abuse the anonymity and open-nature of MOOCs, for example by setting up multiple accounts, due to their amount and aberrant behavior. We identify these users, denoted fake learners, using dedicated algorithms. The methodology for measuring the bias caused by fake learners’ activity combines the ideas of Replication Research and Sensitivity Analysis. We replicate two highly-cited learning analytics studies with and without fake learners data, and compare the results. While in one study, the results were relatively stable against fake learners, in the other, removing the fake learners’ data significantly changed the results. These findings raise concerns regarding the reliability of learning analytics in MOOCs, and highlight the need to develop more robust, generalizable and verifiable research methods. © 2019, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.",Article,Scopus

Objective: We hypothesized that participants who simultaneously engage in both alcohol and Internet use would experience adverse outcomes from their actions, compared to those who just misuse the Internet in the absence of alcohol. Methods: The current study deployed an anonymous online survey comprised of scales measuring several domains such as impulsivity, neglect of responsibilities, depression, frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption, as well as Internet usage. From a large (N = 550) sample of college student surveys, we compared the 39 Internet drinkers with a randomly selected sampled of 39 non-drinking counterparts.

Much of this scrutiny is experienced online, especially around stigmatized topics such as divorce, custody, postpartum depression, and miscarriage. Prior theory suggests that parents might be able to access greater support online when anonymous, but other evidence suggests that anonymity may increase bad behavior. Drawing from ten years of Reddit parenting boards, we show that parents are more likely to discuss potentially stigmatizing topics using anonymous (""throwaway"") accounts. We find that, on average, throwaway comments are more likely to receive a response, receive more responses that are longer, and receive responses that have higher karma scores than topically similar comments posted by non-throwaway accounts. We argue that self-identified throwaway accounts provide a crucial environment for supporting parents with stigmatizing experiences. They also provide a shared platform signal (the throwaway account) which enables other Reddit users to access shared experiences and support. We propose that a hybrid combination of identified and anonymous platforms could provide more supportive online experiences for parents and other users. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The paper has two overall aims. The first aim is theoretical and the ambition is to identify practices and processes distinctive to curation in digital spaces. From this literature the paper argues that contemporary digital curation is characterized by (a) digitally produced and mediated processes, (b) de-professionalization, (c) a combination of productive and consumptive modes, (d) space as a ‘quality stamp’, and (e) an increasingly underlying and/or everyday practice. The second aim is empirical and, through a case study of an online forum dedicated to hi-fi and high-end audio equipment, the ambition is to identify curatorial practices and processes taking place at the forum and to understand how the online forum functions as a curatorial space. More specifically, in the analysis of the empirical material three themes are highlighted. First, personal consumer experiences are expressed through narrated purchases in which the constant pursuit of the ‘perfect audio reproduction system’ is materialized as these narratives involve with the explanations and motivations behind personal reflections and experiences of purchase decisions. Second, the online forum has clear power structures. Third, the online forum deals with geographical dimensions in several ways, e.g. by functioning as a space for legitimization where the lack of distance and the use of (partially) anonymous profiles generate both advantageous and disadvantageous dimensions. © 2019 The Author",Article,Scopus

This study aimed to increase knowledge of problem gambling among adolescents in seven European countries and to assess the effect of demographic and lifestyle factors recorded in the European Network for Addictive Behavior survey (https://www.eunetadb.eu). Methods: A cross-sectional school-based study (n = 13,284) was conducted in Germany, Greece, Iceland, The Netherlands, Poland, Romania and Spain. Anonymous self-completed questionnaires included socio-demographic data, internet usage characteristics, school achievement, parental control, the Internet Addiction Test, the South Oaks Gambling Screen-Revised for Adolescents Test and Achenbach’s Youth Self-Report. Results: 12.5% of the participants reported last year gambling activities either online or offline. 3.6% of the study participants and 28.1% of gamblers (either online or offline) were at risk or had a gambling problem. The study results showed that a higher proportion of adolescents was either at risk or had a gambling problem among males, in the older age group, when the parental educational level was lower/middle, and in the absence of siblings. Furthermore, being at risk or having a gambling problem was associated with lower age at first use of the internet, lower school grades, using the internet 6–7 days per week, and problematic internet use. At risk or problem gamblers had higher scores on all scales of problem behavior and lower scores (lower competence) on activities and academic performance. Conclusions: Our findings underline the need for better gambling legislation and suggest the importance of developing social responsibility tools that may help diminish adolescent gambling involvement, with special attention to males. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,Scopus

This study aimed to examine the relationship of two socially maladaptive personal characteristics, namely psychopathic traits and social anxiety, with online disinhibition. Furthermore, the effect of empathy (affective and cognitive) was examined through moderation analysis. The investigation was based on a context-dependent theoretical framework, according to which, the structural characteristics of cyberspace increase or decrease the expression of certain personal tendencies, thus differentiating an individual's behavior. Overall, 1097 Greek Junior High School students from Northern Greece voluntarily completed an anonymous self-report questionnaire. After construct validity was tested, a two-step latent moderated structural equation modeling was conducted. Results showed that online disinhibition correlated negatively with all variables except affective empathy. Cognitive empathy moderated only the effect of impulsive-irresponsible traits and social anxiety on online disinhibition. Overall, findings show that students with maladaptive personality characteristics have high propensity for online disinhibition. These results can contribute significantly in understanding the phenomenon, as well as in the design of prevention programs aiming at developing the cognitive empathy of impulsive and socially anxious adolescents. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus

One characteristic element is that the data are not anonymous, but they reproduce a personalization and identification of the profiles. Identifiability of the student is implicit in the teaching process, but access to Analytics techniques reveals a fundamental question: “What is the limit?” The answer to this question should be preliminary to any use of data by students, teachers, instructors and managers of the online learning environments.

At the same time, observers have noted an increase of individuals behaving in an unrestrained manner on the Internet, while researchers have reported elevated rates of cyber aggressive behavior. What remains unclear, however, is whether, and how, disinhibition might be related to cyber aggression. In an aim to explore the possible associations, a large sample (total N = 709) of high school (M age = 15.56 years) respondents from New Zealand were recruited, and completed a survey featuring scales assessing personality and technology behaviors, attitudes, habits, and trends. The present study was designed to investigate whether the three dark personality traits of narcissism, psychopathy, and sadism would predict false self perceptions, and in sequence, online disinhibition and aggressive online behavior. All three dark personality traits, as well as false self, were positively associated with online disinhibition. Perceptions of false self were found to be a significant predictor of cyber aggression when mediated by online disinhibition. In the case of cyber aggression, however, psychopathy, sadistic traits, and online disinhibition were found to be significant predictors of this outcome.

Methods: To address this gap, in the current study, we conducted a person-centered analysis (latent profile analysis) to identify subgroups of participants based on endorsed marijuana use motives, and examined the construct validity of the optimal class solution (covariates included sociodemographic (e.g., age), psychiatric (e.g., depression), and marijuana-use indices (e.g., use-frequency, use-related problems). Participants were 898 college students (Mage = 20.93, SDage = 3.10; 68.9% female) who completed an anonymous online survey examining substance use and psychological well-being, were 18 years or older, and endorsed lifetime marijuana use. Data were collected November 2016 through February 2018. Results: Results identified four unique classes of coping, conformity, social, and enhancement marijuana use motives: (a) “Low Motives” (37.6%), (b) “High Conformity” (4.9%), (c) “Low Conformity” (45.8%), and (d) “High Motives” (11.7%). In terms of covariates, higher motive classes tended to report more frequent and problematic use. The two classes uniquely characterized by conformity motives only differed on past-month marijuana use frequency. Conclusions/Importance: The current findings provide evidence that specific classes of motives were not only associated with marijuana use frequency and problems but other risk and protective factors, such as anxiety sensitivity and social support. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus

To find the right opportunities, LinkedIn needs to understand each member's skill set and their expertise levels accurately. However, estimating members' skill expertise is challenging due to lack of ground-truth. So far, the industry relied on either hand-created small scale data, or large scale social gestures containing a lot of social bias (e.g., endorsements). In this paper, we develop the Social Skill Validation, a novel framework of collecting validations for members' skill expertise at the scale of billions of member-skill pairs. Unlike social gestures, we collect signals in an anonymous way to ensure objectiveness. We also develop a machine learning model to make smart suggestions to collect validations more efficiently. With the social skill validation data, we discover the insights on how people evaluate other people in professional social networks. For example, we find that the members with higher seniority do not necessarily get positive evaluations compared to more junior members. We evaluate the value of social skill validation data on predicting who is hired for a job requiring a certain skill, and model using social skill validation outperforms the state-of-the art methods on skill expertise estimation by 10%. Our experiments show that the Social Skill Validation we built provides a novel way to estimate the members' skill expertise accurately at large scale and offers a benchmark to validate social theories on peer evaluation. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Conference Paper,Scopus

A needs assessment survey was conducted to evaluate faculty members’ research support needs and allow a more targeted approach to the development of research services in an academic health sciences library. Methods: The anonymous, web-based survey was distributed via email to full-time researchers at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Toronto. The survey included twenty questions inquiring about researchers’ needs and behaviors across three stages of the research cycle: funding and grant applications, publication and dissemination, and research impact assessment. Data were also collected on researchers’ use of grey literature to identify whether current library efforts to support researchers should be improved in this area. Results: Among library services, researchers considered support for funding and grant applications most valuable and grey literature support least valuable. Researcher engagement with open access publishing models was low, and few participants had self-archived their publications in the university’s institutional repository. Participants reported low interest in altmetrics, and few used online tools to promote or share their research results. Conclusions: Findings indicate that increased efforts should be made to promote and develop services for funding and grant applications. New services are needed to assist researchers in maximizing their research impact and to increase researcher awareness of the benefits of open access publishing models, self-archiving, and altmetrics. © 2019, Medical Library Association.

Security assurance behaviour represents employees’ intentional and effortful actions aimed towards protecting information systems. The behaviour is highly desired as it tackles the human factor within the information security framework. The authors posited that security assurance behaviour is a learned behaviour that can be enhanced by the implementation of information security monitoring. Design/methodology/approach: Theoretical framework underlying this study with six constructs, namely, subjective norm, outcome expectation, information security monitoring, information security policy, self-efficacy and perceived inconvenience, were identified as significant in determining employees’ security assurance behaviour (SAB). The influence of these constructs on SAB could be explained by social cognitive theory and is empirically supported by past studies. An online questionnaire survey as the main research instrument is adopted to elicit information on the six constructs tested in this study. Opinion from industry and academic expert panels on the relevance and face validity of the questionnaire were obtained prior to the survey administration. Findings: Findings from this research indicate that organisations will benefit from information security monitoring by encouraging security behaviours that extend beyond the security policy. This study also demonstrates that employees tend to abandon security behaviour when the behaviour is perceived as inconvenient. Hence, organisations must find ways to reduce the perceived inconvenience using various security automation methods and specialised security training. Reducing perceived inconvenience is a challenge to information security practitioners. Research limitations/implications: There are some limitations in the existing work that could be addressed in future studies. One of them is the possible social desirability bias due to the self-reported measure adopted in the study. Even though the authors have made every effort possible to collect representative responses via anonymous survey, it is still possible that the respondents may not reveal true behaviour as good conduct is generally desired. This may lead to a bias towards favourable behaviour. Practical implications: In general, the present research provides a number of significant insights and valuable information related to security assurance behaviour among employees. The major findings could assist security experts and organisations to develop better strategies and policies for information security protection. Findings of this research also indicate that organisations will benefit from information security monitoring by encouraging security behaviours that extend beyond the security policy. Social implications: In this research, the social cognitive learning theory is used to explain the influence of information security monitoring and other social learning factors on employees’ security assurance behaviour; the finding implies that monitoring emphases expected behaviours and helps to reinforce organisational norms. Monitoring may also accelerate learning when employees become strongly mindful of their behaviours. Hence, it is important for organisations to communicate the monitoring practices implemented, even more imperative whenever security monitoring employed is unobtrusive in nature. Nonetheless, care must be taken in this communication to avoid resentment and mistrust among employees. Originality/value: This study is significant in a number of ways. First, this study highlights significant antecedents of security assurance behaviour, which helps organisations to assess their current practices, which may nurture or suppress information security. Second, using users’ perspective, this study provides recommendations pertaining to monitoring as a form of information security measure. Third, this study provides theoretical contribution to the existing information security literature via the application of the social cognitive learning theory. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,Scopus

Most participants were comfortable with HIV/STD partner notification delivered via GSN apps, either by partner services staff using a health department profile or through an in-app anonymous messaging system. While most participants expressed a responsibility to notify partners on their own, app-based partner notification methods may be preferred for casual or hard-to-reach partners.

All posts are user to user anonymous (i.e., no displayed user handles) and are only displayed in the proximity of the user's location (up to 20 km). It thereby forms local communities and opens the question of how information propagates within and between these communities. We tackle this question by applying established metrics for Twitter hashtags to a ground-truth data set of Jodel posts within Germany that spans three years.

The purpose of this paper is to describe the creation of a student progress “dashboard” in an online Masters programme, and the perceived effectiveness of the tool for engaging students. Design/methodology/approach: Tableau® visualisation software was used to create a dashboard displaying cohort comparison data comprising metrics relating to the continuous assessment components of the Masters programme. An anonymous questionnaire gauged students’ perceptions of the dashboard. Findings: Feedback from students (n=137) suggests the dashboard improved their motivation, incentivising change in study behaviours, and sense of belonging to an online community of learners. It also acted as a conversation catalyst between staff and students, whereby students more readily engaged in dialogue with their personal tutor. Practical implications: Distance learners are more likely to feel isolated and can become demotivated, which contributes to typically higher levels of withdrawal from online programmes vs those delivered on-campus. Tutors may consider communicating progress data as dashboards to enable online students to monitor their academic progress alongside that of their peers, as a motivational tool in an otherwise disparate group of learners, and to reduce feelings of isolation by reminding distance learners that they are part of a larger online community. Originality/value: This paper shares student and tutor perspectives on the use of dashboards to increase online students’ motivation, and examines whether the benefits of a peer-comparison dashboard are reserved for high-achieving students. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,Scopus

This study used an experimental design to explore the impact of report framing (positive, neutral, negative) and youth risk level (low, high) on JPOs' decision making. Pennsylvania-based JPOs (N = 209) participated in an anonymous, online study. Participants read one of six community provider reports about a hypothetical probationer and answered five questions about impressions of the youth and their recommendations to the court. JPOs who read negatively framed information rated compliance and effort significantly lower than those who read positively or neutrally framed information. JPOs who read negatively framed information reported lower likelihood of recommending positive court responses and greater likelihood of recommending negative court responses, particularly when considering probation revocation for youth identified as high risk. JPOs rated compliance significantly higher for youth identified as low risk than for youth identified as high risk. Mediation analyses revealed that JPOs' perceptions of youth significantly mediated the pathway between report framing and court recommendations, but did not mediate the pathway from youth risk level to JPOs' recommendations. Findings suggest that JPOs differentially interpret identical behaviors depending on the framing of information. Given that negatively framed information evoked significantly more unfavorable impressions and punitive recommendations, practitioners should consider how youths' progress on probation is communicated among court personnel, particularly as ongoing juvenile probation reform efforts seek to promote consistent treatment across youth. © 2019 American Psychological Association.",Article,Scopus

In this method, the market operator adopts an honesty promoting mechanism based on direct reward and punishment in which being honest is the most profitable action. In most online marketplaces, a fee or commission is deducted from every payment before settling the account up with the seller. As such, with the dynamic adjustment of the fee, it is possible to reward or punish the seller. The correctness of this method is proven using mathematical models.

Stigma may prevent medical students from seeking psychological help when experiencing distress, which may hinder their job performance and mental health. Compassionate values—preferred principles that guide attitudes and behaviors to focus on the wellness of others—may be a relevant predictor of medical students’ perceptions of psychological help. The present study examined the association between medical students’ compassionate values, help-seeking stigma, and help-seeking attitudes in a convenience sample of medical students. Hypotheses: Rating compassionate values as more important than self-interested values will be associated with less stigma, which in turn will be associated with more positive help-seeking attitudes. Method: There were 220 medical students in their 2nd year of medical training who were recruited in-class and through e-mail between January and March of 2017 at Des Moines University. Students were provided an anonymous online link to a survey composed of validated measures assessing values, psychological distress, and stigma and attitudes related to psychological help. Results: The survey response rate was 41%, leaving a final sample of 91. For every 1 SD increase in the relative importance of compassionate values over self-interested values, help-seeking stigma decreased 0.40 SDs, and help-seeking attitudes increased 0.23 SDs.

The proclaimed goal of metadata collection is to support the quality of service, thus enhancing the Social Internet of Things (SIoT). To most users, it is not obvious that metadata express people's lives to a large degree. Traditionally, security has focused on protecting communication content rather than the metadata associated with it. This provides a thin layer of privacy protection. Thus, a demand exists for privacy-preserving technologies that prevent metadata collection and aggregation. This paper focuses on a service's ability to observe communication metadata that can be exploited to learn users’ identities and behavior patterns. Thus, a novel system, Misty Clouds, is proposed as a platform for creating anonymous Internet connections to address both security and performance issues. The performance evaluation shows that the desired level of anonymity can be achieved with tolerable performance overheads. Through a comparison analysis, it is shown that the new algorithm outperforms an existing algorithm, Tor. Additionally, the features that can facilitate the growth of Misty Clouds into a holistic privacy-preserving platform are discussed.

Most other predictors had non-significant effects when behavioural variables were added to our models. Response-contingent positive reinforcement mediated relationships of behavioural activation with positive affect, negative affect, and satisfaction with life. Our results suggest behavioural variables may explain some affect variance often attributed to other predictors.

Specifically, it holds that individuals who perceive the system as unjust but lack political efficacy, express their anger against the system as support for actors whose behavior disrupts the system’s functioning. These actors are situated outside conventional societal and political structures of power and institutions. To test the social banditry framework, two studies investigate attitudes toward Anonymous, a group of hackers who challenge the status quo using online tactics such as trolling. Study 1 (N = 304) demonstrates that appraising the system as more unjust and perceiving lower political efficacy are positively linked to anger against the system, which in turn predicts more positive attitudes toward Anonymous. In contrast, stronger injustice-fueled anger and stronger political efficacy predict intentions to engage in direct forms of political action, such as protesting or voting. Study 2 (N = 410) replicates these findings, and theorizes and tests the role of individualistic and collectivistic values in predicting vicarious and direct expressions of dissent. Study 2 demonstrates that endorsement of horizontal individualism predicts positive attitudes towards Anonymous, whereas horizontal collectivism predicts engagement in direct political action.

Results: A large majority of participants (more than 80%) perceived the website to be credible, rating it as believable, trustworthy, and accurate. 90% believe the university resources included in the project would help themselves and others overcome struggles and challenges. Other results are also discussed. Discussion: This data from a unique project shows the promise of using an online, integrative tool for a campus resilience initiative. The project is dynamic; analysis of student responses will inform ongoing revisions and refinements. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",Article,Scopus

Our study aims to address this gap through content analysis of 3,697 unique posts on Yik Yak, an anonymous geolocal platform that ceased to exist in 2017. Based on code cooccurrence, we found that trolling posts frequently include community-harming behaviors, such as insults, snark, and the use of vulgar language, and are more likely than other posts to include memes and vulgar language. We also found that territorial community events mediated the extent of community-building and community-harming behaviors, which increased or decreased on the platform according to changes in community composition context. Thus, we conclude that sociotechnical features of the platform in dynamic contexts affected online trolling behaviors by enabling and constraining manifestations of community-harming and community-building behaviors. © 2019 Pnina Fichman and Elizabeth Peters.",Article,Scopus

The current study examined whether anonymous others’ behavior choices within the online comment board may affect viewers’ descriptive norm perceptions in the real world. Results show that, given sufficient total exposure, viewers’ “quasi-statistical sense” allowed them to correctly identify the numerical majority through subtle individual behavior cues embedded in the online comments, which effectively influenced their estimation of the actual e-cigarette use prevalence among the U.S. population.

Various reasons for non-disclosure of personal details or identity falsification were considered, such as the desire to remain anonymous. To this end, a user study was carried out among 169 students of the Israeli academia, via a quantitative method using closed-ended questionnaires. The desire to remain anonymous was found as the most prevalent reason for this behavior and was always ranked as one of the top reasons among every subpopulation that was examined (e.g. men / women, Bachelor / Master students, etc.). In addition, we made an attempt to predict the tendency of non-disclosure of personal details or identity falsification upon website registration, by using a multiple logistic regression taking into account various privacy and anonymity related reasons, such as anonymity awareness and privacy concern.

Myriad theoretical frameworks, including the Barlett Gentile Cyberbullying Model, have emphasized the role of online anonymity perceptions in predicting cyberbullying behavior. In the present study, we implemented a theory-based video intervention program designed to challenge college students' anonymity perceptions to reduce subsequent cyberbullying. Then, we examined their cyberbullying behavior and attitudes longitudinally at points before the intervention (Wave 1), immediately after it (Wave 2), and 2 months later (Wave 3). The results suggest that our intervention was successful, as there was a significant reduction in anonymity perceptions and toxic online disinhibition from Wave 1 to Wave 2 in the intervention group. Also consistent with our theoretical framework, we found that anonymity perceptions at Wave 2 significantly mediated the relationship between intervention group and Wave 3 cyberbullying perpetration.

However, existing trading systems such as ATMs, credit cards, Paypal, and prepaid systems are potentially unsecure and users’ privacy is not sufficiently protected. Because user information can be easily associated with consumption history in the aforementioned trading systems, consumers’ spending habits and interests are retrieved and analyzed by individuals or businesses or people whose intentions may be suspect and without the consent of the consumers themselves. Therefore, the development of e-cash is critical for future e-commerce. In an e-cash system, blind signatures ensure consumer anonymity and prevent e-cash from being linked to its user. However, the anonymous nature of e-cash makes tracing criminal behavior difficult, so e-cash systems with anonymity revocability have been proposed. To thus expand the applicability of e-cash systems, alternatives have become the goal of subsequent studies (e.g., offline transactions, transferability, and divisible e-cash). This study proposed an e-cash system with multiple denominations that enables e-merchants to give customers change when in an offline environment. The proposed system results in convenient transactions regardless of transaction amount and reduces the amount of e-cash users need to deposit in advance. © 2019 Taiwan Academic Network Management Committee.

An understanding of smoking behaviours in this population is essential in order to develop effective interventions. Our analysis aimed to investigate differences in smoking patterns and contexts of smoking between current smokers and recent quitters (<2 years to 1 month). Design and Methods: Data were collected through an online anonymous survey conducted in mid-2015. Participants were recruited online from a variety of social networking sites and community-based mailing groups. Results: Overall 257 lesbian, bisexual and queer women completed the survey, 73% current smokers and 27% recent quitters; nearly all had smoked daily at some point in their lives. Multivariate analysis showed recent quitters were less likely to have some (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05–0.71) or half/most/all (aOR 0.12, 95% CI 0.03–0.048) close friends who smoked compared to none, and were more likely to have a non-smoking (aOR 10.2, 95% CI 3.86–27.0) or no regular partner (aOR 4.01, 95% CI 1.47–10.9) than one who smoked. Non-Anglo-Australian women were also more likely to be recent quitters (aOR 2.45 [95% CI 1.10–5.42]) than Anglo-Australian women.

This study used Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork (EAST) to analyse market activity and understand vulnerabilities to disruption. This involved using the EAST broken-links approach to assess the effects of compromising the transmission of information between tasks and between agents. The analysis identified critical vulnerabilities in the system, which included information involved in registering, depositing funds, communicating listing details to buyers, and communicating dispute resolution messages. This study indicates that systems ergonomics methods—in particular, EAST—can provide insight into system vulnerabilities that might be targeted for disruption.

Research is increasingly showing that the classic individualistic understanding of privacy is insufficient to capture new problems in algorithmic and online contexts. An understanding of privacy as an “interpersonal boundary-control process” (Altman, The environment and social behavior, Brooks and Cole, Monterey, 1975) framing privacy as a social practice necessary to sustain intimate relationships is gaining ground. In this debate, my research is focused on what I refer to as “self-determined groups” which can be defined as groups whose members consciously and willingly perceive themselves as being part of a communicative network. While much attention is given to new forms of algorithmically generated groups, current research on group privacy fails to account for the ways in which self-determined groups are affected by changes brought about by new information technologies. In an explorative case study on self-organized therapy groups, I show how these groups have developed their own approach to privacy protection, functioning on the basis of social practices followed by all participants. This informal approach was effective in pre-digital times, but online, privacy threats have reached a new level extending beyond the scope of a group’s influence. I therefore argue that self-determined sensitive topic groups are left facing what I present as a dilemma: a tension between the seemingly irreconcilable need for connectivity and a low threshold, on the one hand, and the need for privacy and trust, on the other. In light of this dilemma, I argue that we need new sorts of political solutions. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",Article,Scopus

Motivated by the need to account for the idiosyncratic resources available in each shopper’s SN, we distinguish between two types of opinion-seeking behaviours: (i) exploiting, seeking peers’ opinions in one’s core network (ie, online friends), and (ii) exploring, seeking peers’ opinions from one’s extended network (ie, strangers). Using SN theory, we specify what drives these behaviours, and how they influence shoppers’ utilitarian and hedonic experiences in an online product selection task. A free-simulation study, conducted with a restaurant review website connected to the Facebook SN, provided three key insights: (1) Exploitation has a stronger beneficial effect on shoppers’ utilitarian and hedonic experiences than exploration, (2) there is a strong positive influence of social capital (both structural and relational) on shoppers’ propensity to engage in exploitation, and (3) high social capital does not induce the expected extensive substitution of exploration with exploitation. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of online shoppers’ opinion seeking in the increasingly prevalent SN-enabled settings. ©, © Operational Research Society.",Article,Scopus

So far, little research has assessed the extent to which people apply gender stereotypes to animals, and the implications this may have for in-dividuals and groups, particularly female animals. The current study investigated survey respondents’ preference for horses to perform in different sport and leisure practices, based solely on ideas about the sex of the animal. An anonymous online survey explored the preferences of riders for mares, geldings, and stallions for dressage, show-jumping, and trail-riding, and reasons for their choice. A total of 1,032 responses were received. Geldings were the preferred choice, being perceived as safe and reliable, followed by stallions who were valued for their supposed power, presence, and good looks. Overall, mares were the least popular choice, and were discussed in ambivalent terms reflecting broad gender stereotypes which depict females as moody, flighty, and unpredictable. Respondents appeared to draw on gender stereotypes to make judgements about horses and justify their choices.

However, little is known as to the likely intentions to install this technology among those who may benefit the most from it, young novice drivers (17–19 year olds). The current research (a) assessed the extent to which young drivers favour using IVDR technology, and (b) identified personal characteristics and social cognitive processes that underpin their intentions to install this technology. The research drew on past research into the personal correlates of crash involvement, and social cognitive models such as the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), to propose and test a predictive model of intentions to install an IVDR. Following an initial focus group phase, 424 novice drivers (220 males; age: M = 18.25, SD = 0.73) completed an anonymous online questionnaire measuring the study variables. Results suggested that most novice drivers are uncommitted about installing IVDRs in their cars, and most perceive weak, negative social pressure against the installation of IVDR technology. A regression model explained 55% of the variance in intentions to install an IVDR, with all three TPB variables, plus fear of the adverse consequence of not installing, identified as significant predictors. Concern about privacy of information was shown to be a major barrier to taking advantage of IVDR technology.

We focused on oral sex behavior, as it is common in pornography and among young people. Young adults (N = 349; ages 19–30; 54% female) were recruited through a crowdsourcing website. Participants completed an anonymous online survey about the frequency that they observed various sexual behaviors in online pornography, the frequency that they engaged in these behaviors, and their perceptions of the frequency that their peers engaged in these behaviors. Frequency of viewing cunnilingus (men) or fellatio (women) in pornography predicted how often they engaged in oral sex, and this association was mediated by their perceptions of how frequently their peers engaged in oral sex. Peer norms did not mediate how frequently they received oral sex.

U.S. adult bicycle riders responded to an anonymous on-line survey covering bicycling practices, recent traffic accident experiences, and potential confounding variables.

We aimed to explore women's experiences with the CVR in Ontario as well as factors that influenced their decisions to choose the method and continue/discontinue use. Methods: We conducted a multimethod qualitative study that consisted of an anonymous online survey and in-depth telephone interviews with a subset of survey participants. We used descriptive statistics to analyze the survey data and analyzed our interviews for content and themes using both deductive and inductive techniques. Results: From May to July 2015, we received 103 survey responses and conducted 29 in-depth interviews. Many participants described positive experiences with the CVR and found it to be an especially convenient method. Women who discontinued use of the CVR cited high costs, access barriers, and negative media reports as important factors in their decision. Our participants primarily relied on their physicians for contraceptive information but did not feel fully informed about potential side effects. Several women identified the CVR as an “in between” method in the transition from oral contraceptive pills to the intrauterine device. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the CVR represents a convenient and desirable contraceptive option for some women. However, participants expressed a desire for health care providers to provide more comprehensive information about a full range of contraceptive methods. Improving access to a full range of low-cost contraceptives in Ontario seems to be warranted. © 2018 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health",Article,Scopus

These divisive tendencies impede progress in multidisciplinary collaborations to improve human, animal, and environmental health. Inter-professional education (IPE) may repair rifts between health care professions by encouraging students to share their professional identities with colleagues in unrelated health care disciplines. An online survey was conducted at Midwestern University (MWU) to identify baseline perceptions about veterinary medicine among entry-level human health care students before their enrollment in an interprofessional course. Participation was anonymous and voluntary. The survey included Likert-type scales and free-text questions. Survey participants expressed their interest in and respect for the discipline of veterinary medicine, but indicated that their unfamiliarity with the profession hindered their ability to collaborate. Twenty percent of human health care students did not know the length of a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) program and 27.6% were unaware that veterinarians could specialize. Although 83.2% of participants agreed that maintaining the human-animal bond is a central role of the veterinary profession, veterinary contributions to stem cell research, food and water safety, public health, environmental conservation, and the military were infrequently recognized. If IPE is to successfully pave the way for multidisciplinary collaboration, it needs to address these gaps in knowledge and broaden the definition of veterinary practice for future human health care providers. © 2018 AAVMC.",Article,Scopus

Traditionally undergraduate nursing students were preceptored one-to-one with a registered nurse. With an increasingly complex clinical environment and more RNs working part-time, that model has become problematic. The Dedicated Education Unit (DEU) is a model of student learning whereby students are nurtured by all staff in a clinical area, clinical and academic staff collectively support the student and student learning is a collaborative process. In this study, a pilot DEU model in three clinical areas of one District Health Board in New Zealand was evaluated. These DEU are different from others reported in the literature as three unique nursing programmes from two Tertiary education providers (TEPs) in an urban area in New Zealand were involved in the pilot. The approach in this study was a mixed method descriptive evaluation design, undertaken in two phases: phase one was an online anonymous survey completed by 42 nurses and nurse managers employed in three DEUs and 24 undergraduate third year nursing students who were completing their final nine week pre-graduate placement. Phase two was six separate focus groups with registered nurses and undergraduate nursing students. Students (91%) and staff (85%) were satisfied with their participation in the DEU. Students described feeling part of the health care team and staff reported enjoying working with students from different programmes, also noting the supportive DEU structure gave them more opportunity to engage with student learning. Role clarification was an issue which needs to be resolved. Staff from three units at a District Health Board and three unique nursing programmes were able to develop learning partnerships, collaborating together to provide a positive, nurturing learning environment for nursing students and a clinical setting where nurses enjoyed their teaching/coaching roles. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus

However, at present there is limited evidence about UK students’ attitudes towards sexual assault prevention and what they think should be done to effectively address the issue. The purpose of this paper is to explore these views to provide a foundation for the development of a new intervention. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional anonymous online survey was completed by 515 students (73 per cent women; M age: 21.56; 79 per cent heterosexual; and 82.9 per cent white). There were quantitative questions about experiences of sexual assault, attitudes towards sexual consent and victim blaming. Qualitative data were collected regarding participants’ views on what universities should do to target sexual assault. Findings: In line with previous studies, the authors found evidence of commonplace and normalised sexual assault behaviours. Women had more positive attitudes towards explicit consent than men, and were less likely to blame victims of sexual assault who had been drinking. Consent behaviour was predicted by positive views towards consent and lower levels of blaming. Themes relating to “awareness”, “attitudes”, “environment” and “opposition” were identified in the qualitative data. Practical implications: Findings highlight the importance of engaging with students to develop effective prevention measures. Students are likely to find university-led prevention strategies acceptable, but this topic needs to be addressed in the context of the prevailing culture, which may provide an environment where certain behaviours are tolerated. New prevention programmes need to treat the issue as one that is relevant to all students and not just target men as perpetrators and women as victims. Such strategies need to do more than treat this as an isolated issue, to which the solution is re-education about the meaning of consent. Originality/value: There is at present a lack of research evidence about UK students’ views on sexual assault prevention. This exploratory survey highlights areas for consideration when developing new interventions. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,Scopus

However, when such analyses can target single individuals rather than society as a whole, it is clear that privacy becomes a serious concern. This article addresses the challenge of publishing social graphs with proven privacy guarantees. In our adversarial model we consider an active attacker, who has the capability of altering the structure of the social graph before publication by creating new user profiles and establishing relations between them and the targeted network users. We aim to protect graphs satisfying (1, 1)-anonymity, the privacy property that char-acterises the weakest graphs in terms of resistance to active attacks. To that end, we introduce a class of perturbation methods based on edge additions that transform a (1, 1)-anonymous graph into a graph satisfying (k, ℓ)-anonymity for some k > 1 or some ℓ > 1. We prove the correctness of our approach and give a tight upper bound on the number of necessary edge additions. Experimental results, obtained on real-life graphs and a large collection of randomly generated graphs, show that our methods effectively prevent attacks from active adversaries with the capability of adding one node to the network, and additionally provide some level of protection against more capable attackers. We also conducted experiments on real-life social graphs which show that the outputs of state-of-the-art community detection algorithms on the anonymised graphs is similar to those obtained on the original graphs. © 2018, University of Skovde.

Positive religious coping (PRC) has been associated with decreases in the use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana. Investigations examining prescription drug misuse and PRC found that higher levels of PRC were related to a reduction in the misuse of some prescription drugs. However, the literature has yet to identify an inverse relationship between PRC and the misuse of prescription stimulants (MPS) among undergraduates. Objective: Examine the association between religious coping and past-year MPS in a sample of undergraduate students. Methods: Undergraduates were recruited to complete an anonymous online survey from three universities (1 private, 2 public) in the United States. Results: The sample consisted of 908 undergraduates between the ages of 18 and 25. Statistical analyses revealed that higher levels of PRC were associated with a reduction in past-year MPS. A separate model found that attending religious events also decreased the behavior. Conversely older students, males, Greek organization affiliation, a lower GPA and having a current stimulant prescription all increased the odds of reporting past-year MPS. Negative religious coping and a student's race were not significantly associated with MPS. Conclusions: Findings indicate that PRC skills have the potential to reduce MPS in college students. Therefore, it is possible that the development of similar secular skills could have the same effect. Future studies should explore the role that positive coping skills having on the reduction of MPS among undergraduates regardless of religious conviction. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus

In this paper, by taking the anonymous large-scale real-world data from Snapchat as an example, we develop ClusChurn, a systematic two-step framework for interpretable new user clustering and churn prediction, based on the intuition that proper user clustering can help understand and predict user churn. Therefore, ClusChurn firstly groups new users into interpretable typical clusters, based on their activities on the platform and ego-network structures. Then we design a novel deep learning pipeline based on LSTM and attention to accurately predict user churn with very limited initial behavior data, by leveraging the correlations among users' multidimensional activities and the underlying user types. ClusChurn is also able to predict user types, which enables rapid reactions to different types of user churn. Extensive data analysis and experiments show that ClusChurn provides valuable insight into user behaviors, and achieves state-of-the-art churn prediction performance. The whole framework is deployed as a data analysis pipeline, delivering real-time data analysis and prediction results to multiple relevant teams for business intelligence uses. It is also general enough to be readily adopted by any online systems with user behavior data. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Conference Paper,Scopus

First, we define an anomaly as any perturbation in the transportation network with respect to a typical day: temporary interruption, intermittent habit shifts, closed stations, unusual high/low number of entrances in a station. The Parisian metro network with 300 stations and millions of daily trips is considered as a case study. In this paper, we present four approaches for the task of anomaly detection in a transportation network using smart card logs. The first three approaches involve the inference of a daily temporal prototype of each metro station and the use of a distance denoting the compatibility of a particular day and its inferred prototype. We introduce two simple and strong baselines relying on a differential modeling between stations and prototypes in the raw-log space. We implemented a raw version (sensitive to volume change) as well as a normalized version (sensitive to behavior changes). The third approach is an original matrix factorization algorithm that computes a dictionary of typical behaviors shared across stations and the corresponding weights allowing the reconstruction of denoised station profiles. We propose to measure the distance between stations and prototypes directly in the latent space. The main advantage resides in its compactness allowing to describe each station profile and the inherent variability within a few parameters. The last approach is a user-based model in which abnormal behaviors are first detected for each user at the log level and then aggregated spatially and temporally; as a consequence, this approach is heavier and requires to follow users, at the opposite of the previous ones that operate on anonymous log data. On top of that, our contribution regards the evaluation framework: we listed particular days but we also mined RATP1 Twitter account to obtain (partial) ground truth information about operating incidents. Experiments show that matrix factorization is very robust in various situations while the last user-based model is particularly efficient to detect small incidents reported in the twitter dataset. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

With the rapid growth of social networks on the Web, the most of interactions are conducted among unknown individuals. On the other hand, with increasing the biased behaviors in online communities, ability to assess the level of trustworthiness of a person before interacting with him has an important influence on users' decisions. Trust inference is a method used for this purpose. This paper studies propagating trust values along trust relationships in order to estimate the reliability of an anonymous person from the point of view of the user who intends to trust him/her. It describes a new approach for predicting trust values in social networks. The proposed method selects the most reliable trust paths from a source node to a destination node. In order to select the optimal paths, a new relation for calculating trustable coefficient based on previous performance of users in the social network is proposed. In ciao dataset there is a column called helpfulness. Helpfulness values represent previous performance of users in the social network. Advantages of this algorithm is its simplicity in trust calculation, using a new entity in dataset and its improvement in accuracy. The results of the experiments on Ciao dataset indicate that accuracy of the proposed method in evaluating trust values is higher than well-known methods in this area including TidalTrust, MoleTrust methods. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of transitioning on transgender persons’ sexual preferences and partnerships. Data were collected through an anonymous online survey. Questions focused on timing of gender transition in relation to change in sexual preference. Transgender individuals have a variety of sexual partners, predominantly cisgender, and may change sexual preference when they transition. Transitioning can be associated with having no primary sexual partner, despite past sexual partnerships. Length of time between identifying as transgender and starting the transition might be associated with changing sexual partner preference, particularly in transgender women. The emerging trends of sexual partnerships and changing sexual preferences related to the transition in this study warrant further investigation.

As making friends is a basic way to create user's social relationship, friend recommendation is proposed to help users expand their social circles in OSNs. However, traditional friend recommendation process poses several crucial privacy breaches in OSNs, such as identity theft and relationship privacy leakage. Aimed to solve this problem, different from traditional friend recommendation schemes, based on the common interests by characterizing user's social behaviors/activities, we identify the threat model, and then propose a k-degree anonymous friend recommendation (KFR) scheme. Firstly, we abstract OSN as a hypergraph and then propose an edge segmentation algorithm to hide user's identity privacy and social relationship privacy. Subsequently, based on users’ common interests, we design a similarity calculation algorithm. Finally, combined the similarity calculation algorithm with the segmentation tree (ST) technique, a novel k-degree anonymous friend recommendation scheme is proposed. The experiments carried out on real datasets show that the proposed scheme is scalable and effective. © 2017",Article,Scopus

On the other hand, online tracking requires some exposure of the user's platform, which may result in compromised privacy. This work relies on a concept borrowed from the trusted computing area, Direct Anonymous Attestation, to enable remote IP licensing and activation mechanisms preserving the full anonymity of the end user, i.e., making it impossible for the Activation Server (AS) in charge of distributing the IP core license to track the user's behavior across the SoC lifecycle.

Blunts are hollowed out cigars or cigarillos that are filled with marijuana. Objectives: The current study was designed to determine the use patterns and characteristics of African American, Hispanic and White young adult Twitter users who reported past month blunt use. Methods: Young adults (N = 753, 74% male) who reported past month blunt use were recruited via Twitter to participate in a brief anonymous online survey about their blunt use. Results: Findings revealed that African American young adults initiated blunt smoking at an earlier age (14.8 years), reported more days of blunt smoking in the past month (23.2 days) and smoked more blunts in the past month (27.2 blunts) than their Hispanic (16.5 years, 19.7 days, and 15.4 blunts) and White (18.1 years, 15.8 days, and 22.2 blunts) counterparts, p <.01. African American young adults were more likely than their White counterparts to report physical craving as an obstacle to quitting blunt smoking. Several racial/ethnic differences were also found on attitudes about blunt use and reasons for initiating and continuing to smoke blunts. Conclusions: Findings suggest that blunt use patterns and attitudes about blunt use vary by race/ethnicity. Understanding racial/ethnic differences in blunt use patterns and characteristics offers opportunities to tailor future interventions and enhance outcomes among African American, Hispanic and White young adults. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus

This is reflected by more and more applications enabling anonymous interactions. However, do social media users behave different when they are anonymous? In our research, we investigated social media services meant for solely anonymous use (Jodel) and for widely spread non-anonymous sharing of pictures and videos (Instagram). This study examines the impact of anonymity on the behavior of users on Jodel compared to their non-anonymous use of Instagram as well as the differences between the user types: producer, consumer, and participant. Our approach is based on the uses and gratifications theory (U & GT) by E. Katz, specifically on the sought gratifications (motivations) of self-presentation, information, socialization, and entertainment. Since Jodel is mostly used in Germany, we developed an online survey in German. The questions addressed the three different user types and were subdivided according to the four motivation categories of the U & GT. In total 664 test persons completed the questionnaire. The results show that anonymity indeed influences users' usage behavior depending on user types and different U & GT categories. © Regina Kasakowskij, Natalie Friedrich, Kaja J.

Although the affordances of social media sites often allow aggressive online content to be stored and searched, the actual content of aggressive posts has not been explored in great detail. The purpose of this content analysis was to examine discursive strategies used in aggressive posts, responses, and bystander comments on a social media site that is both popular among young adolescents and a known online site of cyberbullying behavior. A total of 993 question–answer dyads were analyzed. In this sample, aggressors are almost exclusively anonymous. Posters of aggressive content demean profile owners on the basis of social status, romantic success, emotional instability, perceived physical attractiveness, and age. Most profile owners attracted a comment from at least one supportive bystander. In general, bystander comments either attacked aggressive posters for their cruelty or their cowardice at being anonymous or supported profile owners by affirming their physical attractiveness or social competence. A power differential between aggressor and victim is a key feature that distinguishes bullying from other social conflicts among adolescents. Results show that, in the absence of physical power, online aggressors use discursive strategies to affirm their dominance over their victims. In turn, victims of online aggression, as well as supportive bystanders, use a variety of methods to attempt to resolve the power differential. Our findings have implications for development of digital citizenship and anti-cyberbullying initiatives that promote effective bystander behavior online. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.",Article,Scopus

Commoditization enables outsourcing, thus lowering entry barriers for aspiring criminals, and potentially driving further growth in cybercrime. While there is evidence in the literature of specific examples of cybercrime commoditization, the overall phenomenon is much less understood. Which parts of cybercrime value chains are successfully commoditized, and which are not? What kind of revenue do criminal business-to-business (B2B) services generate and how fast are they growing? We use longitudinal data from eight online anonymous marketplaces over six years, from the original Silk Road to AlphaBay, and track the evolution of commoditization on these markets. We develop a conceptual model of the value chain components for dominant criminal business models. We then identify the market supply for these components over time. We find evidence of commoditization in most components, but the outsourcing options are highly restricted and transaction volume is often modest. Cash-out services feature the most listings and generate the largest revenue. Consistent with behavior observed in the context of narcotic sales, we also find a significant amount of revenue in retail cybercrime, i.e., business-to-consumer (B2C) rather than business-to-business. We conservatively estimate the overall revenue for cybercrime commodities on online anonymous markets to be at least US $15M between 2011-2017.

The social media-sharing service Instagram gained popularity in the recent years. Every registered user is able to comment on the uploaded media and express one's sentiment about it. Especially celebrities seem to attract attention from mostly anonymous haters and admires. This investigation focuses on cyber hate and cyber love on a polarizing celebrity - Miley Cyrus. She gained fame as a teenage girl in the TV show Hannah Montana in 2006. She wanted to change her image and earned negative response for her performance at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2013 and her music clip of the song ""Wrecking Ball"". Does a polarizing celebrity like Miley Cyrus get positive or negative response on social media for her behavior? Additional research includes a time series on the sentiment towards Miley Cyrus' posts. Are there differences between the sentiments expressed on the official Miley Cyrus account and fan-based accounts? Methods. To discover what amount of sentiments (negative, positive, neutral) prevail in the comment section of a well-known celebrity and whether there is more negative or positive feedback, a dictionary-based sentiment analysis on more than 660,000 filtered comments of media concerning to Miley Cyrus has been performed. First the data has been collected through the Instagram API from the official as well as fan-based Miley Cyrus accounts. Afterwards the comments were preprocessed by a python script. The comments have been translated, words without any impact have been replaced with a general term (e.g. usernames or links), and comments with no sense (e.g. ""first""), advertisements, as well as chain mails have been deleted. Finally, the sentiment of each comment has been computed. Results. The official Instagram account of Miley Cyrus has the least positive comments and is more susceptible for negative comments. Miley Cyrus gets more positive than negative feedback for her critical behavior; and the sentiment value decreases over time as she acts less polarizing and more unappealing.

In this exploratory study, we proposed an experimental framework to investigate and model male/female differences in attitudes towards online privacy and anonymity among Israeli students. Our aim was to comparatively model men and women’s online privacy attitudes, and to assess the online privacy gender gap. Method. Various factors related to the user’s online privacy and anonymity were considered, such as awareness of anonymous threats made online, concern for protecting personal information on the Internet, online privacy self-efficacy, online privacy literacy and users’ tendency to engage in privacy paradox behaviour, i.e., personal data disclosure despite the awareness of anonymity and privacy threats. Analysis. A user study was carried out among 169 Israeli academic students through a quantitative method using closed-ended questionnaires. The subjects’ responses were analysed using standard statistical measures. We then proposed a summarized comparative model for the two sexes’ online privacy behaviour. Results. We found that a digital gap still exists between men and women regarding technological knowledge and skills used to protect their identity and personal information on the Web. Interestingly, users’ tendency to engage in privacy paradox behaviour was not higher among men despite their higher level of technological online privacy literacy compared to women. Conclusions. Women’s relatively high online privacy self-efficacy level and their low awareness of technological threat do not match their relatively low technological online privacy literacy level. This leads to a lower ability to protect their identity and personal information as compared to men. We conclude that further steps should be taken to eliminate the inter-gender technological gap in online privacy and anonymity awareness and literacy. © the authors, 2017.",Article,Scopus

Research examining Tinder use and its association with behavioral outcomes is scarce. The objectives of this study were to explore the correlates of Tinder use and risky sexual behaviors in young adults. Participants aged 18-26 were invited to complete an anonymous online questionnaire between January and May 2016. Measures included sociodemographic characteristics, Tinder use, health related behaviors, risky sexual behaviors, and sexual attitudes. Associations among these variables were estimated using multivariate logistic regressions. The final sample consisted of 415 participants (n = 166 Tinder users; n = 249 nonusers). Greater likelihood of using Tinder was associated with a higher level of education (OR = 2.18) and greater reported need for sex (OR = 1.64), while decreased likelihood of using Tinder was associated with a higher level of academic achievement (OR = 0.63), lower sexual permissiveness (OR = 0.58), living with parents or relatives (OR = 0.38), and being in a serious relationship (OR = 0.24). Higher odds of reporting nonconsensual sex (OR = 3.22) and having five or more previous sexual partners (OR = 2.81) were found in Tinder users. Tinder use was not significantly associated with condom use. This study describes significant correlates of using Tinder and highlights a relationship between Tinder use with nonconsensual sex and number of previous sexual partners. These findings have salience for aiding public health interventions to effectively design interventions targeted at reducing risky sexual behaviors online. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Article,Scopus

Reputation formation-individuals' ability to share information about others' deeds and misdeeds-has been found to promote cooperation. However, these findings are mostly based on small-scale laboratory and field experiments or on data gathered from online markets embedded in functioning legal systems. Using a unique data set of transactions in a cryptomarket for illegal drugs, we analyse the effect of buyers' ratings of finished transactions on sellers' business success. Cryptomarkets are online marketplaces in the so-called Dark Web, which can only be accessed by means of encryption software that conceals users' identities and locations. The encryption technology makes it virtually impossible for law enforcement to intervene in these market exchanges. We find that sellers with a better rating history charge higher prices and sell their merchandise faster than sellers with no or a bad rating history. Our results demonstrate how reputation creates real incentives for cooperative behaviour at a large scale, in the absence of law enforcement and among anonymous actors with doubtful intentions.

Bioscience exams pose particular concerns for these students, which may lead to students adopting a surface-approach to learning. Objectives To promote student collective understanding of bioscience, improve their confidence for the final exam, and improve deeper understanding of bioscience. Design In order to address exam anxiety, and improve student understanding of content, this student engagement project involved nursing students collaborating in small groups to develop multiple-choice questions and answers, which became available to the entire student cohort. Settings This study was conducted at two campuses of an Australian university, within a first year bioscience subject as part of the undergraduate nursing programme. Participants All students enrolled in the subject were encouraged to attend face-to-face workshops, and collaborate in revision question writing. Online anonymous questionnaires were used to invite student feedback on this initiative; 79 respondents completed this feedback. Methods Students collaborated in groups to write revision questions as part of in-class activities. These questions were made available on the student online learning site for revision. An online feedback survey was deployed at the conclusion of all workshops for this subject, with questions rated using a Likert scale. Results Participants indicated that they enjoyed the opportunity to collaborate in this activity, and almost all of these respondents used these questions in their exam preparation. There was strong agreement that this activity improved their confidence for the final exam. Importantly, almost two-thirds of respondents agreed that writing questions improved their understanding of content, and assisted in their active reflection of content. Conclusions Overall, this initiative revealed various potential benefits for the students, including promoting bioscience understanding and confidence. This may improve their long-term understanding of bioscience for nursing practice, as registered nurses' bioscience knowledge can impact on patient outcomes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus

If an individual starts profusely swearing on a lecture, they are most likely expelled from the class or even from the course. But what if they do it outside the lecture amongst their classmates, amongst a group of anonymous individuals – or by themselves? In this article, we study how students use profanities in source code when they are completing programming assignments on a massive open online course (MOOC). We examine how common it is to curse in source code as well as whether specific assignments incite more cursing than others. Additionally, we investigate differences between participants with regards to cursing. Our results indicate that a considerable amount of participants write curse words whilst programming, but most clean their code for the final submission. The data also shows that there are different degrees of profanity in use, ranging from quite inoffensive words to offensive racial slurs. Finally, we discuss options that one may take when individuals who swear are identified, starting from rescinding their right to study.",Conference Paper,Scopus

A total of 269 participants provided details about their playing habits, daily exercise routines, and interactions with their family and dog, and how these were impacted by playing the game. Playing Pokémon GO affected the amount of time players spent with other people and pets, with 43.2% of respondents reporting an increased amount of time spent with family/household members and 52.3% reporting they spent more time with their dog. Additionally, 62.9% of participants reported spending more time walking their dog since starting to play. A statistically significant increase in amount of exercise obtained was found when comparing pre-to post-game levels. A number of respondents reported feeling less anxious leaving the house (38.6%), interacting with strangers (39.7%), and going to new places (39.4%) after they began playing Pokémon GO.

Methods: We administered an anonymous online survey to 148 men who reported seeing a general medical provider in the last 12 months. All participants resided in Oklahoma. Results: When controlling for HIV status, previous STI diagnosis, and age, logistic regression modeling yielded significant results (x2(9) = 31.22, p &lt;.001) predicting 70.3% of cases. Age and overall disclosure of sexual orientation and/or sexual behaviors were significant predictors. Conclusion: Individuals who did not disclose their sexual orientation or same-sex behaviors to friends and family members were less likely to inform their providers of their sexual orientation. Disclosure of MSM status provides additional opportunities to enhance primary and secondary prevention strategies in rural and conservative areas that are necessary to optimize health, including but not limited to HIV screening and discussion of pre-exposure prophylaxis that their counterparts in urban settings more readily receive. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus

Results: The students witnessed a wide range of challenging behaviors, also referred to as responsive behaviors, in GLTC residents. The most frequent behaviors included agitation/restlessness, repetitive talk, and wandering. Although behaviors such as physical aggression and disinhibited sexual behavior were experienced less frequently, students found these behaviors the most distressing. Students felt ill-prepared to manage these behaviors, which was associated with higher levels of distress. Conclusion: The students demonstrated good theoretical knowledge about responsive behaviors, but the lack of personal experience in managing such behaviors left the students feeling ill-prepared and distressed.

Students from 255 secondary schools throughout the Galicia region of Spain completed an anonymous, online survey in school, with 39,993 having sufficient data for analyses. We used two-stage cluster analysis to identify the groups, and then compared demographics, online risks and PIU rates across groups. We identified five clusters: occasional users (21.4%), moderate users with parental control (22.2%), moderate users without parental control (22.1%), habitual users with parent-child conflict (16.8%), and intensive users (17.5%). The heaviest user groups had the highest rates of any online risk (>60%) and PIU (>25%). The majority of adolescents with frequent Internet use have engaged in online risky experiences. Such behaviors, and problematic Internet use, are higher among adolescents without parental control over their use, so empowering parents to moderate their child's Internet use is encouraged.

It will look at the weaknesses of these tools and how the behavior of cybercriminals will sometimes lead them to use tools in a nonoptimal manner, creating opportunities for law enforcement to identify and apprehend them. The criminal domain this article focuses on is carding, the online trade in stolen payment card details and the consequent criminal misuse of such data. However, these findings could be applied more broadly, as many of the analyzed tools are used across (cyber) criminal domains. This article is a continuation of earlier work, in which a crime script analysis of 25 carding tutorials presented the tools that cybercriminals use to cash-out stolen payment card details while remaining anonymous. We use these tutorials and an analysis of the literature to identify how they can be used incorrectly and create a typology of potential behavioral and technological pitfalls in these tools. Finally, we conclude that finding pitfalls in the usage of tools by cybercriminals has the potential to increase the efficiency of disruption, interception, and prevention approaches. However, in future work, interviews with law enforcement experts and convicted cybercriminals or still active users should be used to analyze the operational security of cybercriminals in more depth. © 2017, © 2017 SAGE Publications.",Article,Scopus

The study's main goal was to examine the interplay between medical students' sleep knowledge, personal attitudes towards sleep, and their sleep habits. Methods: An anonymous online survey was created and emailed to all students enrolled at a large metropolitan medical school. Data on demographics, sleep perception, and habits in addition to self-reported measures of students' sleep knowledge, beliefs, and sleepiness were collected. Results: There were 261, out of a possible 720, responses to the survey. While 71.5% of respondents believed that they needed >7 h of sleep, only 24.9% of respondents stated they average >7 h of sleep. During the week of an examination, only 15.3% of students stated they averaged >7 h of sleep. A comparison of pre-clinical and clinical students revealed that reported median sleep during a school or rotation night was significantly lower in clinical students as compared to pre-clinical students while mean sleep during examination weeks between the two groups was not statistically different. In regard to sleep knowledge, clinical students were more knowledgeable (65.53% correct) than pre-clinical students (39.83% correct) (t(1) = -8.9, p =.00). However, there was no difference in the assessment of dysfunctional beliefs between the two groups (66.0 for preclinical students, 64.7 for clinical students (t(1) = 0.37, p =.71)) while clinical students had a higher score of sleepiness compared to pre-clinical students (9.12 to 7.83, t(1) = -2.3, p =.023). Conclusions: A majority of medical students are sleeping an inadequate amount of time during their 4 years, and as they progress from the pre-clinical to the clinical years, the amount of time they sleep decreases even though their knowledge about sleep increases. Increased awareness around sleep health is required beyond sleep education, as medical students appear to need help translating knowledge into strategies to improve their own sleep and well-being. © 2017 Academic Psychiatry.",Article,Scopus

Using threads from 4chan's /b/ board (an anonymous imageboard known for trolling and other aggressive behaviors) as a case study, the author illustrates how some aggressive behaviors online are memetic; that is, they are uncritical recapitulations of previous behaviors or of the way users believe they are “supposed” to behave. First, the author examines /b/'s technical design, ethos, and collective identity to understand the nature of the offensive content posted to the board. Then, she analyzes two threads wherein transwomen (the most vehemently denigrated identity on /b/) self-identified and how the collective identity employed its memetic responses; the first transwoman incited /b/'s memetic wrath, while the second employed identity rhetoric that ruptured the collective identity, thus effectively deterring /b/'s memetic behaviors and opening constructive dialog. This case study emphasizes the pressing need for more teacher-scholars to perform research and develop pedagogy centered on anonymous and pseudonymous social media spaces. It is imperative to disrupt negative memetic behaviors so that we can find, create, and seize more opportunities to open the kinds of productive, democratic discourses that online aggression tends to silence. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Article,Scopus

Through a field experiment that uses data from the Facebook API to measure social ties that connect our subjects, we separate forward-looking instrumental trust from static intrinsic trust and show that the level of instrumental trust and forgiveness, and the effect of forgiveness on deterring future defections, crucially depend on the strength of social ties. We find that the level of trust under social repeated play is greater than the level of trust under anonymous repeated play, which in turn is greater than the level of trust under anonymous one shot games.

The objective of this study was to determine the overlapping features of BED and FA through a comparison of the individual scales of commonly used tools including the Binge Eating Scale (BES) and the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) in a sample of Australian adults. Adults (<18 years of age) were invited to complete an anonymous online survey on FA. Binge eating was assessed through the BES and addictive eating behaviours were assessed through the YFAS (n=1344). The prevalence and severity of both FA and binge eating increased across weight categories. The overall correlation between the total score from the BES and FA symptoms was r=0.76, p < 0.001; for females it was r=0.77, p < 0.001, and for males it was r=0.65, p < 0.001. Total BES score and the BES emotion factor were most often associated with FA symptoms, as was demonstrated to produce stronger correlations with FA symptoms. In contrast, the BES behaviour factor was less strongly associated to FA with the majority of correlations <0.6.

Methods: Students at 2 university campuses in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, the 2 largest cities in Vietnam, were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey. Data collection was conducted during March and May 2016. Results: There were 741 respondents, of whom nearly 90% of students (665) were motorcycle riders. Overall prevalence of mobile phone use while riding is 80.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77.9–83.9%) with calling having a higher level of prevalence than texting or searching for information while riding: 74% (95% CI, 70.7–77.3%) vs. 51.7% (95% CI, 47.9–55.5%) and 49.9% (95% CI, 46.1–53.7%), respectively.

Previous research on youth risk taking behaviors suggests emotion regulation is a key predictor of outcomes. Specifically, the ability to respond in adaptive rather than maladaptive ways is often associated with challenges of impulsivity, poor distress tolerance, and adolescent substance use. Objectives: The current study considers data from RHS students in order to answer research questions concerning impulsivity and emotion regulation of youth working to change their risk trajectories in comparison to group of typically developing youth. Methods: Participants (n = 114) in the study were composed of students enrolled in 3 RHS programs and a comparison group of similar aged youth (15–20 years) without an identified SUD. Data collection occurred through an anonymous online survey set of four measures of reactivity and impulsivity, emotion regulation, and parent and peer influence, as well as an online version of the Stroop Inhibitory Control Task. Results: Participants in the three RHS groups reported decreased emotion regulation abilities, increased impulsivity and increased peer influence when compared to the comparison group; differential effects within RHS are presented. Conclusions/Importance: Results are consistent with the extant literature that difficulty regulating emotions is associated with an increased risk for substance abuse and suggests these difficulties persist in early recovery. Results also suggest the need to better understand how different operating philosophies of programs influence student outcomes and the recovery process. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus

Methods: Sample consisted of 1,752 adolescents aged 15 to 16 years who had participated in the 2014 edition of the WHO Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey in Spain. Data were collected by means of anonymous online questionnaires, and hierarchical multiple regression models (with sex and age as controls and including interactions among the examined predictors) were used for statistical analysis. Results: Emotional and psychosocial factors showed significant interactive effects on substance use. Emotional control, which tended to buffer the effects of potential risk factors, and peers' substance use were consistent predictors of substance use. In contrast, the role of other factors depended on the substance under study, with depression and peers' conventional behavior being part of interactive terms for tobacco use and cannabis use only, and the quality of parent–child relationships being absent from the final model on cannabis use. Conclusions/Importance: Exploring interactions and potential substance-specific effects is fundamental to reach a better understanding of how emotional and psychosocial factors work in concert relative to substance use in adolescence. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus

Can those traits contribute to greater exchange of opinion and information across the sociodemographic boundaries that often limit interaction between social strata? To answer this question concerning online homophily, we combined survey data on 7,287 users (aged 18 and above) of a Korean online dating advice platform with their behavioral data from June 2015 to August 2015 and explored whether advice exchange occurred between users with similar sociodemographic and personality traits. On this platform, two types of interactions occurred as follows: (1) responses to a randomly distributed problem submitted by an advice seeker and (2) the seeker's indication of approval of any of the responses given. The study found that (1) a receiver was more likely to respond to problems submitted by seekers of a comparable age and that (2) seekers were more likely to approve of a response if the seeker and receiver had similar educational backgrounds. By contrast, homophily based on personality traits was not observed even though some personality traits significantly affected the likelihood of both response and approval. Our findings suggest that online communication may breed sociodemographic homophily, whether based on age or education, more than expected or intended while not easily fostering alternative forms of homophily, such as personality homophily, which can potentially cut across borders dividing sociodemographic groups. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.",Article,Scopus

Specifically, the People Nearby service reads in the current geographic location of the device to locate a list of other people using WeChat who are in the same vicinity. The user can then request to establish a WeChat friendship relation with any of the users on the list. In this paper, we explore: (i) if one gender tends to use the People Nearby service more than another; (ii) if users of People Nearby are more anonymous than ordinary WeChat users; (iii) if ordinary WeChat users are more anonymous than Twitter users. We also take an in-depth examination of the user anonymity and demographics in a combined fashion and examine: (iv) if ordinary WeChat females are more anonymous than ordinary males; (v) if People Nearby females are more anonymous than People Nearby males.

This article presents analysis of online debate on the BBC news website in November 2013, comprising 864 readers' responses to an article entitled ‘Germany allows ‘indeterminate’ gender at birth’. It explores how discourse reflecting Western essentialist beliefs about people having one sex or ‘the other’ is maintained in debates conducted in this online public space. Comments were coded thematically and are presented under five sub-headings: overall evaluation of the German law; discussing and disputing statistics and ‘facts’; binary categorisations; religion and politics; and ‘conversations’ and threads. Although for many the mapping of binary sex onto gender was unquestionable, this view was strongly disputed by commentators who questioned the meanings of ‘natural’ and ‘normal’, raised the possibility of removing societal binary male-female distinctions or saw maleness–femaleness as a continuum. While recognising that online commentators are anonymous and can control their self-presentation, this animated discussion suggests that social classifications as male or female, even if questioned, remain fundamental in public debate in the early 21st century. © 2016 The Authors.

This paper reports the first stage of an ongoing information behaviour research project undertaken with a rural Indigenous community in South Australia. Method. Twenty-one Ngarrindjeri volunteers participated in the field study. Permission was granted and extensive community consultations were conducted. Analysis. Questionnaires and interview transcriptions were analysed using the open coding method. Results. Ngarrindjeri people’s everyday information needs included the gathering of information on weather, jobs, entertainment, culture, education, and health services. The Internet (37.6%) was the most frequently used source of information where participants obtained information from social media, specialised Websites and search engines. However, non-Internet resources accounted for 62.4% of overall information sources and these included local sources such as families and relatives, Elders, and local TV channels. Ngarrindjeri participants were distressed by a lack of computer literacy, costs of maintaining a network, and inadequate facilities in the rural area. Despite this, their attitudes towards the Internet were still positive: they recognised the value of technologies and would like to distribute their culture online, with caution and in an appropriate manner. Conclusion. The study provides insights into indigenous Australians’ information behaviour and Internet use in their daily lives. Future research directions are also discussed. This research project was funded by the auDA Foundation Pty Ltd and Division of ITEE Research Development Grant at the University of South Australia.

The purpose of the present study was to address four specific aims: 1) To replicate findings from prior studies regarding educators' perspectives of mental health promotion in school; 2) To extend prior research by examining specific needs for mental health training; 3) To compare the responses between the educators in rural schools and urban schools within the same geographic and political context of a large Midwestern state; and 4) To explore similarities and differences of the educators' perspectives based on participants' roles including administrators, teachers and school mental health providers. Methods A total of 786 educators including 127 administrators in a large Midwestern state completed a one-time, anonymous online survey. Descriptive analyses were employed to explore the perspectives of educators regarding the current status of mental health promotion in school. Additionally, independent samples t-tests were run to examine the differences in the educators' perspectives based on region (rural vs. urban). Finally, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine the differences in the educators' perspectives based on participants' roles. Results Results replicated previous findings, indicating a large percentage of educators reporting a high level of concerns for student mental health needs (93%) and the need for further training in mental health (85%). Mental health disorders, behavior management, and specialized skills such as social skills were identified as the top three areas of need for further training. While no differences were found between educators in urban and rural schools in other topics, significantly more respondents in rural schools (27%) reported that their schools hire mental health professionals as compared to urban schools (13%). The ANOVA results indicated that school-based mental health professionals and administrators are significantly more concerned about students' mental health needs than teachers (p = 0.000). Conclusion A majority of participants take students' mental health issues seriously and many feel that current resources and training opportunities could be expanded. An area of future research could be exploring current mental health trainings provided to educators and examine how their specific training needs are addressed. An important strategy to decrease mental health care disparity by geographic region may be statewide initiatives to increase the number of mental health professionals in rural areas. The discrepancy in the level of mental health concerns expressed by teachers and administrators may suggest a need for school-wide initiatives to foster shared commitments to promoting students' mental health across various staff roles. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus

With regard to the former, the authors focus on three factors (perceived value, trust, and perceived risk), and investigate whether and to what extent habit moderates the relationship between SNS-switching intention and actual switching behavior. Design/methodology/approach: Data collection for this study was carried out using an anonymous survey. The questionnaire was devised based on the literature review. It consisted of a total of 34 items, all of which used the seven-point Likert scale, and was divided into nine sections. Data collection lasted for approximately three months from March to May 2015. Data analysis used SPSS and SmartPLS statistical software packages. First, the descriptive statistics were computed. Next, reliability as a measure of internal consistency was calculated. Then, the relations between all factors were explored. Findings: Before they switch, users usually evaluate the perceived values and risks of the SNSs they might join, as well as establish the degrees of trust with respect to those networks. Hence, this study is potentially useful to SNS providers planning their business strategies, and/or seeking to optimize their services based on a detailed understanding of the concerns of users and potential users. Originality/value: This study is of considerable importance to the future development of research on switching intention behavior theory and practice, adding to the body of work on specific frameworks that explain the SNS-switching intention and behavior. The main theoretical implication is that the epistemic value component of the perceived value may not significantly affect switching intentions, at least in the SNS context. In addition, the results regarding the moderating effects of habits are a useful confirmation, in the SNS context, of the findings of a small but important body of prior studies. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,Scopus

The current research used a mixed experimental (type of feedback) and quasi-experimental (gender) design to examine the editing behaviors of college students during a public, collaborative editing task to identify potential factors underlying the Wikipedia gender gap. Overall, women edited more than men. However, in the editing condition most akin to Wikipedia, wherein female peer editors were underrepresented in the essay edits and feedback from peers was neutral, men trended towards adding more content than woman. Women added more content than men in this male-dominated essay condition when peer editors modeled constructive feedback. Although the type of edits from peer editors was counterbalanced, participants typically viewed an anonymous peer editor as male. Women viewed the anonymous editor as more critical of the participant's own work when compared with a gender-neutral peer editor. These results suggest that visible female editors on Wikipedia and broader encouragement of the use of constructive feedback may begin to alleviate the Wikipedia gender gap. Furthermore, the relatively high proportion of anonymous editors may exacerbate the Wikipedia gender gap, as anonymity may often be perceived as male and more critical. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus

The primary research question of this inquiry is: Can a stable market, defying the state, emerge under conditions of online anonymity? The article shows that Silk Road was built on a contradiction. On the one hand, strong cryptographic anonymity was embraced because it facilitated hiding from the state. On the other hand, the very same cryptographic anonymity made it difficult to impose rules and create a stable market. Silk Road sought to cultivate subcultural norms to ensure proper behavior in face of anonymity but they were not strong enough to control the behavior enabled by its architecture. © 2017, Published with license by Taylor & Francis.",Article,Scopus

The paper at hand analyzes vandalism and damage in Wikipedia with regard to the time it is conducted and the country it originates from. First, we identify vandalism and damaging edits via ex post facto evidence by mining Wikipedia's revert graph. Second, we geolocate the cohort of edits from anonymous Wikipedia editors using their associated IP addresses and edit times, showing the feasibility of reliable historic geolocation with respect to country and time zone, even under limited geolocation data. Third, we conduct the first spatiotemporal analysis of vandalism on Wikipedia. Our analysis reveals significant differences for vandalism activities during the day, and for different days of the week, seasons, countries of origin, as well as Wikipedia's languages. For the analyzed countries, the ratio is typically highest at nonsummer workday mornings, with additional peaks after break times. We hence assume that Wikipedia vandalism is linked to labor, perhaps serving as relief from stress or boredom, whereas cultural differences have a large effect.

In this paper we will describe changes in patterns of use of these tools by undergraduate students at the University of Edinburgh, and discuss the context and possible motivations for this shift as well as exploring issues of risk, privacy and long-Term impact on online profiles. This paper draws upon the Managing Your Digital Footprint research project, reflecting on data collected through surveys in 2014 (n=587); 2015 (n=870); and 2016 (n=578). Questions on social media use and behaviours associated with personal online tracks and traces were explored across all three surveys, providing insight into shifts in adoption and use of these tools. Furthermore, the research project ""A Live Pulse: Yik Yak in teaching learning and assessment at Edinburgh"" (2016-17), will be introduced. Adoption and use of anonymous/pseudonymous tools sit in a wider context that we believe is important. The most popular social media sites increasingly attracting older new users; major advertising campaigns embed these spaces as mainstream, rather than edgy or for the young. At the same time young people are increasingly exposed to cyber security messages at school and appear to be deliberately turning to niche and/or hidden social media sites to bond and communicate. Measures like the UK Investigatory Powers Act (2016) are also making issues of surveillance, internet privacy and regulation a more pressing concern. As social media sites merge (e.g. Facebook acquiring WhatsApp and Instagram; Microsoft acquiring LinkedIn), as well as aggressive advertising (e.g. Google, Facebook), data use is becoming more visible. Anonymous/ pseudonymous sites appear to provide anonymity or ephemerality, and a degree of safety from surveillance (state, platform/advertiser, parental or employer), but we raise concerns about the etiquette and unfiltered expression in these spaces and perceived versus actual risks. Our work highlights the need for Higher Education to take seriously the risk, privacy, and long-Term impact of this type of anonymous/pseudonymous social media usage.",Conference Paper,Scopus

The main advantage is essentially the decoupling of the system integration phase from the development of the single cores. The use of third-party IPs, however, raises many challenges, especially related to the security of the manufactured devices, as the dynamic installation/activation of new functions makes it more difficult to track the distribution and use of licensed IPs. In that respect, an effective solution involves the online interaction between each end user's device and the IP provider, but this online tracking comes at the price of compromised user's privacy. Bearing in mind this consideration, the work proposes the adoption of a concept borrowed from the trusted computing area, the so-called Direct Anonymous Attestation, to enable remote IP licensing and activation mechanisms while fully preserving the anonymity of the end user, i.e., making it impossible to infer the user's identity from its behaviour as seen by the activation server. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of an ad-hoc protocol, called Remote Anonymous Activation Protocol (RAAP), as well as a proof-of-concept implementation on a commercial target device, which encompasses an FPGA and a general purpose processing system.

The purpose of this paper is to ascertain levels of mental health literacy in UK university students and to examine whether mental health literacy is associated with better mental health outcomes and intentions to seek professional care. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 380 university students at a university in the south of England completed online surveys measuring multiple dimensions of mental health literacy, help-seeking behaviour, distress, and well-being. Findings: Mental health literacy in the students sampled was lower than seen in previous research. Women exhibited higher levels of mental health literacy than men and postgraduate students scored higher than undergraduate students. Participants with previous mental health problems had higher levels of mental health literacy than those with no history of mental health problems. Individuals were most likely to want to seek support from a partner or family member and most participants indicated they would be able to access mental health information online. Mental health literacy was significantly positively correlated with help-seeking behaviour, but not significantly correlated with distress or well-being. Practical implications: Strategies, such as anonymous online resources, should be designed to help UK university students become more knowledgeable about mental health and comfortable with seeking appropriate support. Originality/value: This study is the first to examine multiple dimensions of mental health literacy in UK university students and compare it to help-seeking behaviour, distress, and well-being. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,Scopus

The internet is the perfect place for terrorist recruitment to find and target future members. Online, it is easy to remain anonymous and to keep recruitment a secret process. Here, identities are easily masked, and information is easily transmitted. In previous approaches, the system has been modelled to identify the terrorist recruiters and block it. So, we propose to develop model which identifies behavioural patterns among serious online groups of terrorist supporters Contrary to the previous approaches, the model has been developed to identify behavioural patterns among serious online groups of terrorist supporters. Our proposal discusses about the operational details like routes for financing and avoiding drone strikes Cyber police and other anti-terrorist watchdogs could monitor their build up and transitions and thwart the potential onset of a burst of violence. With that road map, law enforcement can better navigate what is going on, who is doing what, while state security agencies can better monitor what might be developing. It could provide a roadmap for cyber police and other anti-terror watchdogs to their activity and indicators when conditions are ripe for the onset of real-world attacks.

Michael Minkov observed that culture influences thought; even when people think they are in control, cultural biases are actually controlling their thoughts. Cultural values endure, and because they do, these cultural values leave artifacts can be revealed in thought patterns. This philosophy serves as a foundation for further work in progress on name choices by hackers. In this study, we examined 10 years' worth of Zone-H archives where hacker names that identified with national identities were analysed using Hofstede's cultural framework to determine whether culture may play a role in hacker name and name choices. The findings revealed cultural preferences in several of the six cultural dimensions. In addition, trending the results showed significant findings in two cultural dimensions: (1) masculinity versus femininity and (2) uncertainty avoidance.

(b) Do collective guilt and students' evaluations of professors mediate these relationships? Method: White American undergraduate students (N = 614, 66.3% females, 64.7% first year, mean age of 19.3 years [age SD = 1.5]) completed an anonymous online survey. Students imagined they were taking a racial diversity course with either a Black or a White male professor who presented either White privilege or Black disadvantage statements. Participants then completed surveys that assessed their evaluations of the professor, collective guilt, beliefs regarding racial inequity, and MRWP. Results: Students evaluated White professors as having lower expertise, learning conduciveness, and warmth/intelligence but rated Black professors as more biased. Consistent with the inequality-framing model, intergroup sensitivity effect (ISE), and findings from prejudice confrontation research, White professors induced greater acknowledgment of racial inequity when they discussed White privilege rather than Black disadvantage. But, Black professors induced more external MRWP when they presented White privilege rather than Black disadvantage. Students' perceptions of the professors' warmth/intelligence determined the effectiveness of the inequity message while perceptions of the professors' expertise, judgmental, and conduciveness to learning determined students' concerns about appearing prejudiced. Conclusions: The presenters' race/ethnicity and how they frame racial inequity information affect students' evaluation of the presenters, the message effectiveness, and students' external MRWP. © 2016 American Psychological Association.",Article,Scopus

Few of the participants (16%–32%) reported that they were or would be always honest across these sites, and even fewer (0–2%) suspected that others were always honest in these different online venues. In terms of types of lie, most (55–90%) believed that others were at least sometimes lying about their age, gender, activities, interests, and appearance across the four online venues. Ninety percent expected others to lie at least sometimes about their appearance (most expected lie type) and 55% expected others to lie at least sometimes about their gender (least expected lie type). However, although they expected people to lie more about their gender on sites with more anonymity and invisibility (like anonymous chat rooms and sexual websites), they expected equal rates of lies about appearance across all four websites, even on sites where users provide pictures and have shared acquaintances. Moreover, perceptions of others’ lying behavior on the venue were more significant predictors of own lying behavior than any of the personal characteristics we measured (i.e., Machiavellianism, psychopathy, extraversion, or internet addiction). The importance of mutuality was further reinforced by qualitative comments that showed that, in addition to lying to look more attractive or for privacy or protection concerns, some people lie “because everyone lies on the internet.” © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus

There is a growing body of research into the maltreatment of adult athletes, exploring issues such as abusive acts or behaviours against the individual, including acts of physical and/or psychological violence to the person. Existing research, however, focuses upon face-to-face behaviours, and to date the nature of abuse in online spaces has been overlooked. It is becoming ever more apparent that virtual environments create optimal climates for abuse to occur due to the ability for individuals to communicate in an instantaneous, uncontrolled and often anonymous manner in virtual worlds. Using a netnographic approach, an analysis of a popular social media platform (Twitter) was conducted to examine the types of abuse present in online environments. This paper presents a conceptual typology, identifying four broad types of abuse in this setting; physical, sexual, emotional and discriminatory; examples of each form are presented.

These evolutions pose some challenges for the media companies in terms of shifting business models, but they also bring them new possibilities in managing their relations with users. An important first step here is to identify the online users and turn anonymous users into registered ones. Today, however, there is a myriad of logins and passwords one needs when surfing the web, which can make the management of these logins a challenge for users. The Belgian media industry seeks to deal with this challenge by introducing a collaborative nation-wide single sign-on (SSO) system across their digital platforms, called Media ID. This paper provides four scenarios describing the potential outcomes in terms of user adoption and hence market potential of the integration of a SSO service into a regional media system. The scenarios are built upon focus group interviews with media users and in-depth interviews with the stakeholders from the involved media companies. They describe to what extent the innovative service can influence user's online media consumption behaviour but also to what extent the media companies can implement it, two factors that mutually shape each other. In the discussion of the scenarios, requirements to ensure the broad applicability of a SSO service by both media users and media organizations are identified. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd .

Method: Undergraduates at University of Wisconsin– Madison completed an anonymous online survey detailing vocal use, symptomatology, impact, sociodemographics, and voice-related quality of life. Univariate analyses and multivariate regression models isolated risk factors for lifetime and point prevalence rates of a voice disorder. Results: Vocal health and associated factors were analyzed for 652 students (predominantly 18–25 years of age). Lifetime prevalence rate of a voice disorder was 33.9% (point prevalence = 4.45%). Change in voice function (odds ratio [OR] = 2.77), seasonal or chronic postnasal drip (OR = 2.11), hoarseness (OR = 2.08), and restrictions to social activity (OR = 2.07; all p < .05) were identified as the strongest predictors of disorder.

As a result, there is a growing need to scientifically examine their psychosocial implications. This study developed and tested the Online Relationship Initiation Scale (ORIS) through classical and item response theory analyses to address this need. An anonymous online survey included 713 adults, aged 18-71 years. The ORIS was tested on psychometric properties and examined for associations with gender and several standardized psychosocial measures. Results demonstrated unidimensionality of nine items, strong factor loadings, and high internal consistency (α = 0.90, ωt = 0.94). All items captured significant information on the latent trait and none showed differential item functioning by sex, age group, or ethnicity. General linear modeling confirmed hypotheses that men were more likely than women to initiate online relationships. Online relationship initiation was not strongly associated with perceived social support, but was positively related to financial distress, and willingness to engage in infidelity or unprotected sex. The ORIS was negatively associated with age and satisfaction with life and showed modest interactions with ethnicity and hours online. This study provided empirical evidence for an interpersonal relationship initiation construct. The ORIS was shown to be a psychometrically sound instrument for evaluating online interpersonal behaviors and their associations with psychosocial and demographic factors. Such psychometrically sound instruments can be useful in exploring online interpersonal behaviors and their significance. Copyright © 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",Article,Scopus

But these efforts suffer from two issues: (1) They emphasize the holistic measurement and evaluation of class environment, but ignore the individual effects in the class. (2) They do not consider interpersonal behaviors among the students and teachers. In this paper, we address these two challenges as follows. First, we introduce a half anonymous survey instrument to assist individual opinion data collection. Second, we adopt social network analysis to explore relationships among students. An empirical class test was conducted to verify the method. Experimental results have demonstrated the ability of our approach to discover the class environment problems with high reliability and veracity. © 2015 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus

These markets look like true spot markets for tasks rather than markets for employment. Despite appearances, we find via a field experiment that workers act more like parties to an employment contract: workers quickly form wage reference points and react negatively to proposed wage cuts by quitting. However, they can be mollified with ""reasonable"" justifications for why wages are being cut, highlighting the importance of fairness considerations in their decision making. We find some evidence that ""unreasonable"" justifications for wage cuts reduce subsequent work quality. We also find that not explicitly presenting the worker with a decision about continuing to work eliminates ""quits,"" with no apparent reduction in work quality. One interpretation for this finding is that workers have a strong expectation that they are party to a quasi-employment relationship where terms are not changed, and the default behavior is to continue working. © 2016 INFORMS.",Article,Scopus

Access to the Internet is growing through the global use of mobile phones and apps, in both developed and less developed countries. This pattern is particularly relevant for clinicians and researchers who are interested in the use of technologies to disseminate perinatal depression interventions. In a cross-sectional anonymous online survey for English and Spanish-speaking perinatal women, 509 pregnant (77.6 percent) and postpartum (22.4 percent) women provided demographic and Information and Communication Technologies data. Results indicated that the single device with greatest access was the mobile phone (47.5 percent). The majority of the sample had Internet access through mobile phones, computers, or both. Significant differences in socioeconomic status were found for Internet seeking behavior of health-related information and downloading apps between those with and without Internet access. Ninety percent of respondents (n = 267) searched for health-related information and 72.3 percent had downloaded any kind of app. More than half of respondents (57 percent, n = 188) downloaded a health-related app and 26.9 percent reported having paid for the apps.

Social identity theory predicts that hierarchy and stereotypes may limit receptiveness to interprofessional feedback, but literature on this is sparse. This study explores perceptions among health professions students regarding interprofessional peer feedback received after a team exercise. Method In 2012-2013, students from seven health professions schools (medicine, pharmacy, nursing, dentistry, physical therapy, dietetics, and social work) participated in a team-based interprofessional exercise early in clinical training. Afterward, they wrote anonymous feedback comments for each other. Each student subsequently completed an online survey to rate the usefulness and positivity (on five-point scales) of feedback received and guessed each comment's source. Data analysis included analysis of variance to examine interactions (on usefulness and positivity ratings) between profession of feedback recipients and providers. Results Of 353 study participants, 242 (68.6%) accessed the feedback and 221 (62.6%) completed the survey. Overall, students perceived the feedback as useful (means across professions = 3.84-4.27) and positive (means = 4.17-4.86). There was no main effect of profession of the feedback provider, and no interactions between profession of recipient and profession of provider regardless of whether the actual or guessed provider profession was entered into the analysis. Conclusions These findings suggest that students have positive perceptions of interprofessional feedback without systematic bias against any specific group. Whether students actually use interprofessional feedback for performance improvement and remain receptive toward such feedback as they progress in their professional education deserves further study. © 2016 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.",Article,Scopus

Due to the difficulty in tracking and categorising the places that individuals choose to visit, this is largely unexplored. However, the recent popularity of location-based social networks (LBSNs) provides a means to gain new insight into this question through checkins - records that are made by LBSN users of their presence at specific street level locations. A web-based participatory survey was used to collect the personality traits and checkin behaviour of 174 anonymous users, who, through their common check-ins, formed a network with 5373 edges and an approximate edge density of 35%. We assess the degree of overlap in personality traits for users visiting common locations, as detected by user checkins. We find that people with similar high levels of conscientiousness, openness or agreeableness tended to have checked-in locations in common. The findings for extraverts were unexpected in that they did not provide evidence of individuals assorting at the same locations, contrary to predictions. Individuals high in neuroticism were in line with expectations, they did not tend to have locations in common. Unanticipated results concerning disagreeableness are of particular interest and suggest that different venue types and distinctive characteristics may act as attractors for people with particularly selective tendencies.

In these networks, and for such applications, connectivity ensures good performance of applications while trust is assumed to always hold, so as collaboration and good behavior are always guaranteed. In this paper, we study the impact of differential behavior of users on performance in typical social network-enabled routing applications. We classify users into either collaborative or rational (probabilistically collaborative) and study the impact of this classification and the associated behavior of users on the performance of such applications, including random walk-based routing, shortest path based routing, breadth-first-search based routing, and Dijkstra routing. By experimenting with real-world social network traces, we make several interesting observations. First, we show that some of the existing social graphs have high routing costs, demonstrating poor structure that prevents their use in such applications. Second, we study the factors that make probabilistically collaborative nodes important for the performance of the routing protocol within the entire network and demonstrate that the importance of these nodes stems from their topological features rather than their percentage of all the nodes within the network. © 2016 KSII.",Article,Scopus

The application has been a consistent topic of discussion on U.S. college campuses and in the media, often described in very negative terms. This study sought to gain an empirical understanding of the nature of communication on the application. Across three days, 4001 anonymous posts from 42 different US college campuses were collected and analyzed using emergent inductive content analysis. Overall, the content associated with each post varied widely, with a large percentage of posts (45.1%, n = 1802) focused upon campus life and announcements or proclamations. Also frequent were posts that included profanity or vulgarities (13.5%, n = 544), posts that asked apparently rhetorical questions (10.1%, n = 405) and posts related to dating, sex and sexuality (9.2%, n = 366). Many of the posts were arguably inflammatory, but few contained individualized personal information. A large proportion of posts reflected domains of perceived normative behaviors on college campuses, such as alcohol, drug use and sexuality. Importantly, posts analyzed were highly context specific, limiting the research team's ability to fully understand or appreciate the impact of a post. Finally, even in light of the highly contextual nature of the posts, based on our limited analysis, the authors of this manuscript conclude that Yik Yak, while a tool with the potential for abuse and misuse, does not represent a significant threat to young adults. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Current research into the effects of viewing pornography on attitudes and behaviours of young people is patchy and often contradictory. Via an anonymous survey of 218 young people and focus group discussions with 23 teaching professionals in outer London schools, this study examines whether young people and teaching professionals consider pornography use to have harmful effects, and if they feel schools should be incorporating teaching about online pornography in their educational programmes. Findings reveal that young people and teachers perceive there to be many negative effects of viewing pornography, particularly at a young age. Young people and teachers agree that schools should teach about the risks associated with online pornography viewing.

However, protecting individuals through the use of anonymous applications presents a serious problem in terms of offender identification where malicious use has occurred. Although numerous anonymous communication applications exist, due to the volume of media criticism attracted, indicating its role in a rise in acts of cyberbullying in the United States of America; this article focuses on the anonymous bulletin board Yik Yak. To demonstrate the limitations present when attempting to determine an offender's identity, a digital forensic analysis was carried out on an iPhone handset used for communicating via Yik Yak and the key findings highlighted. Since Yik Yak is growing in popularity, the article proceeds to examine the challenges for regulating use in University campus environments in England and Wales given their status as a 'private communications service providers', remaining outside the confines of the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014. A discussion of hypothetical university campus network infrastructures is presented in order to identify the challenge of identifying malicious Yik Yak users, concluding that for anonymous communication applications such as Yik Yak, reliance should be placed upon sufficient data retention periods in order to assist the investigation of criminal behaviour and offender identification. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus

These identities have pseudo anonymous properties, and as such some users abuse multiple accounts to perform undesirable actions, such as posting false or misleading remarks comments that praise or defame the work of others. The detection of multiple user accounts that are controlled by an individual or organization is important. Herein, we define the problem as sockpuppet gang (SPG) detection. First, we analyze user sentiment orientation to topics based on emotional phrases extracted from their posted comments. Then we evaluate the similarity between sentiment orientations of user account pairs, and build a similar-orientation network (SON) where each vertex represents a user account on a social media site. In an SON, an edge exists only if the two user accounts have similar sentiment orientations to most topics. The boundary between detected SPGs may be indistinct, thus by analyzing account posting behavior features we propose a multiple random walk method to iteratively remeasure the weight of each edge. Finally, we adopt multiple community detection algorithms to detect SPGs in the network. User accounts in the same SPG are considered to be controlled by the same individual or organization.

It was unknown if adding an element of competition, to an established journal club, would increase nurses' participation. Objective: To explore the impact on attendance and participation in a hospital-wide nursing journal club through the introduction of an element of competition. Design: A descriptive exploratory study. Setting and participants: An Australian specialist tertiary paediatric hospital with over 1600 nurses. Methods: In 2013, 12 hospital wards/departments were randomly assigned a month each to present journal club. Nurses were supported to evaluate an article according to a published framework. A predetermined rubric guided marking. Post competition, all hospital nurses received an anonymous online survey invitation. Demographic, Likert scale and qualitative data were collected. Questions elicited attitudes and perceived barriers or facilitators to participation in the journal club. Results: Compared to 2012, there was a statistically significant increase in journal club attendance (2013 median = 20.5 [IQR = 18.2, 27.7] vs. 2012 median = 9 [IQR = 6.5, 12.5], Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.01).

One approach to reducing fatalities is expanding overdose response education to broader audiences. This study examined responses to a web-based overdose education tool. Methods: The results of 422 anonymous surveys submitted on www.stopoverdose.org were analyzed for participant demographics, knowledge of opioid overdose recognition and response, and knowledge of Washington's Good Samaritan overdose law. Characteristics, knowledge, and planned behavior of respondents with professional versus personal interest in overdose education were compared. Results: Most respondents were age 35 or older (57%) and female (65%). The mean score on the knowledge quiz for overdose recognition and response items was 16.2 out of 18, and 1.5 out of 2 possible points for items concerning the law. Respondents indicating professional interest were significantly more likely to be 35 or older (p =.001) and to have received prior overdose education (p <.001), but less likely to know someone at risk for opioid overdose (p <.001) or report planning to obtain take-home naloxone (p <.001). No significant differences were found in overdose knowledge scores between groups. Conclusions: Online training may be effective among individuals with professional and personal interest in overdose, as general knowledge scores of overdose response were high among both groups. Lower scores reflecting knowledge of the law suggest that the web-based training may not have adequately presented this information. Overall, results suggest that a web-based platform may be a promising approach to basic overdose education. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus

Exploiting these online users as crowd workers is promising yet nontrivial. To efficiently leverage human intelligence or crowd wisdom, we need to address the following issues: 1) how to motivate users to participate and 2) how to discourage malicious behaviors, such as copying answers or making random guesses. Furthermore, as low-quality answers may degrade the accuracy of synthetic results sharply, the last issue is how to weed them out. In this paper, we present MacroWiz, a simple yet effective framework to manage crowd wisdom on MSNs. Given a crowdsourcing task, MacroWiz motivates online users to contribute their knowledge or opinions, and assists the task requester in collecting answers, selecting reliable ones, and making ultimate decisions. The platform consists of two functional units: wisdom collection and answer selection. The former estimates and gathers the minimum number of answers required to satisfy the task requirement conservatively, while the latter analyzes the accuracy, the effectiveness, and the cost of each answer, based on which it selects those with high accuracy and low cost by solving a dual-objective optimization problem. We validate the effectiveness of our platform by using MovieLens data sets, which contain over one million anonymous ratings of movies. The experimental results show that MacroWiz significantly reduces the latency in making decisions and provides high-quality answers with low cost. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,Scopus

Drawing on a digital ethnography of Silk Road, we develop the notion of constructive activism to extend the lexicon of concepts available to discuss forms of online activism. Monitoring of the cryptomarket took place between June 2011 and its closure in October 2013. Just before and after the closure of the marketplace we conducted anonymous online interviews with 17 people who reported buying drugs on Silk Road (1.0). These interviews were conducted synchronously and interactively through encrypted instant messaging. Participants discussed harnessing and developing the technological tools needed to access Silk Road and engage within the Silk Road community. For participants Silk Road was not just a market for trading drugs: it facilitated a shared experience of personal freedom within a libertarian philosophical framework, where open discussions about stigmatized behaviours were encouraged and supported. Tensions between public activism against drug prohibition and the need to hide one's identity as a drug user from public scrutiny were partially resolved through community actions that internalized these politics, rather than engaging in forms of online activism that are intended to have real-world political effects. Most aptly described through van de Sande's (2015) concept of prefigurative politics, they sought to transform their values into built environments that were designed to socially engineer a more permissive digital reality, which we refer to as constructive activism. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",Article,Scopus

First, we examine how users use the platform, analyzing patterns in posting, popularity of yaks, and vocabulary. As a comparison, we look at posting patterns on Twitter, which has similar limitations on lengths of posts, but is public and global rather than anonymous and local. Upon a sample of 2.9M posts (1.9M yaks and 1M geotagged tweets) from 20 locations across the USA, we find that interactions on Yik Yak are specific to its location limitations and reflect the schedules of its targeted demographic, college students. Second, we test two hypotheses related to anonymity and communication: (i) whether vulgarity usage is more likely to be acceptable, and (ii) whether unique topics emerge in conversations on Yik Yak. We find that posts on Yik Yak are only slightly more likely to contain vulgarities, and we do not find any significant bias in topic distributions on Yik Yak versus on Twitter; however, differences in vocabulary and most discriminative words used suggest the need for further analysis. © Copyright 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

The paper attempts to make a connection between altruistic travel motivations and the applicability of VolunTourism experiences on resumes in pursuit of differentiation in the job market. Design/methodology/approach: The sample frame for this paper consisted of two groups of students who, at the time of the study, had participated in a curriculum-based study-abroad programme featuring VolunTourism components in the past five years (post-study) or were confirmed to embark on a trip shortly thereafter (pre-study). The surveys comprised a mixed-method approach. Quantitative and qualitative information was gathered through anonymous online surveys and personal interviews. Findings: The responses obtained in personal interviews reflect the results obtained in the online surveys. Students who sat down for a personal interview were enthusiastic and supportive of VolunTourism. Three-quarters of the interviewees were 25 and younger. None of them had previously participated in study abroad programme, but they did have previous volunteering experience through high school curriculum or personal engagement. Besides their enthusiasm for doing good, students believed VolunTourism to enhance their image and increase their competitive advantage in the job market. Research limitations/implications: The surveys do not explore the impact of short-term VolunTourism opportunities in general but are focused on specific curriculum-based programmes. The bulk of participants came from the Tourism Management programme, whose familiarity with Niche, Eco and VolunTourism products could potentially have created a bias towards their experience and the usefulness of such excursions with respect to their career aspirations. Participants had travelled to a variety of destinations, influencing the comparability of the impressions. Practical implications: Commercial tour operators can direct their corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts at giving back to its key profit generators, thereby offsetting the negative impacts that such vacation models entail. Students have pointed to the availability of many willing hands that populate the beaches of All-Inclusive Resorts, and it appears that they would happily participate, were pre-organized VolunTourism excursions readily available. The obligation for tour operators is clearly to maintain authenticity and integrity and not to capitalize on this new opportunity for pure revenue generation. Social implications: Travellers are obligated to treat VolunTourism opportunities with respect and sincerity, to combat the negative stigma of careless self-gratification and self-promotion attributed to this type of travel. VolunTourists must be vigilant, demand transparency from VolunTourism providers and not fall prey to “green washing” strategies, allowing monies to subtly flow out of destinations and into the pockets of corporations. Originality/value: This paper explores the complexities surrounding short-term VolunTourism experiences and their impact on students and young professionals. It narrowed in on the co-existence of altruistic motives in serving destination communities, and the expectation of acquiring skills to further expand resume credentials. The paper was inspired by recent market developments, wherein high-end tourism services providers were seen to be offering one-day volunteering excursions to their clientele. The question that presented itself was to investigate if there is an emerging trend towards personal social responsibility, whereby students and young professionals emulate behaviours modelled by industry leaders, and it appears that this is the case. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Article,Scopus

It supports TCP applications and packs upper-layer application data into encrypted equal-sized cells with onion routing to hide private information of users. However, we note that the current Tor design cannot conceal certain application behaviors. For example, P2P applications usually upload and download files simultaneously, and this behavioral feature is also kept in Tor traffic. Motivated by this observation, we investigate a new attack against Tor, application classification attack, which can recognize application types from Tor traffic. An attacker first carefully selects some flow features such as burst volumes and directions to represent the application behaviors and takes advantage of some efficient machine-learning algorithm (e.g., Profile Hidden Markov Model) to model different types of applications. Then he or she can use these established models to classify target's Tor traffic and infer its application type. We have implemented the application classification attack on Tor using parallel computing, and our experiments validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the attack. We argue that the disclosure of application type information is a serious threat to Tor users' anonymity because it can be used to reduce the anonymity set and facilitate other attacks. We also present guidelines to defend against application classification attack. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Young women between 18 and 26 years of age who were currently enrolled in a college course comprised the study sample. Participants completed an anonymous online survey that assessed sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviors, gynecological healthcare utilization, and perception of risk to HPV-associated diseases. Multivariable analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between racial/ethnic status and HPV vaccination status.RESULTS: Of the 835 with complete data (51.0 % white, 16.5 % black, 13.8 % Hispanic, 8.3 % Asian, and 9.9 % other), 53 % had initiated (receipt of at least one dose) the three-dose HPV vaccine series. Of those who initiated, 70 % indicated that they had completed all three doses. In adjusted analysis, blacks were significantly less likely to report initiation [adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) = 0.78; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.63, 0.97] and completion (aPR = 0.64; 95 % CI: 0.48, 0.84) of the three dose HPV vaccine as compared to whites. Although completion rates were lower in all other racial/ethnic groups as compared to whites, these rates did not reach statistical significance.CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with research from other types of settings and demonstrate lower initiation and completion rates of HPV vaccine among black women attending college as compared to their white counterparts.

The users are randomly and repeatedly matched into pairs of clients and servers, and each server can choose to provide high-quality or low-quality services to the client with whom it is matched. Since the users are anonymous and incur high costs (e.g., exert high effort) in providing high-quality services, it is crucial that the platform incentivizes users to provide high-quality services. Rating mechanisms have been shown to work effectively as incentive schemes in such platforms. A rating mechanism labels each user by a rating, which summarizes the user's past behaviors, recommends a desirable behavior to each server (e.g., provide higher-quality services for clients with higher ratings), and updates each server's rating based on the recommendation and its client's report on the service quality. Based on this recommendation, a low-rating user is less likely to obtain high-quality services, thereby providing users with incentives to obtain high ratings by providing high-quality services. However, if monitoring or reporting is imperfect-clients do not perfectly assess the quality or the reports are lost-a user's rating may not be updated correctly. In the presence of such errors, existing rating mechanisms cannot achieve the social optimum. In this article, we propose the first rating mechanism that does achieve the social optimum, even in the presence of monitoring or reporting errors. On one hand, the socially-optimal rating mechanism needs to be complicated enough, because the optimal recommended behavior depends not only on the current rating distribution, but also (necessarily) on the history of past rating distributions in the platform. On the other hand, we prove that the social optimum can be achieved by ""simple"" rating mechanisms that use binary rating labels and a small set of (three) recommended behaviors. We provide design guidelines of socially-optimal rating mechanisms and a low-complexity online algorithm for the rating mechanism to determine the optimal recommended behavior. © 2015 ACM 2167-8375/2015/07-ART25 $15.00.",Conference Paper,Scopus

The research conducted at Technical College in Bjelovar, on the sample of 141 students in nursing and mechatronics, about their habits, knowledge and attitude towards alcohol led to the results that show notable difference between those two study programs. Students filled out an anonymous online survey that included 39 questions related to the socioeconomic status of the individual, drinking habits, knowledge about alcohol and students’ attitudes towards alcohol and alcoholism. The given results showed more positive attitude towards alcohol and higher tendency of irresponsible behavior by students of Mechatronics. It is noticed that students have negative attitude towards alcohol only if they consume it under the influence of society. Alcohol consumption under the peer influence leads to more negative attitude towards alcoholics among nursing students, while mechatronics students have a positive attitude. All in all, nursing students have positive attitude towards those suffering from alcoholism and they are willing to work with them whereas it is not the case among mechatronics students. The negative attitude towards alcoholics, tendency to consumption and little knowledge of consequences of consuming alcohol can be justified by high tolerance of our society towards consumption of alcohol, absence of effective program of addiction prevention and quality education of all study programs. © 2015 KBCSM, Zagreb.",Article,Scopus

Displacement of face-to-face time by online activities would be expected to negatively impact empathic skills. Since there is little direct empirical research on this topic, the present study sought to determine the nature of the relationship between Internet usage and empathy. More than 1000 young adults completed an anonymous online questionnaire that asked about daily media usage, real-world empathy, virtual empathy, social support and demographic information. The results showed that, in general, going online had very small negative impacts upon cognitive and affective real-world empathy and actually improved time spent in face-to-face communication. Video gaming reduced real-world empathy in both females and males but did not reduce face-to-face time. Also, virtual empathy was positively correlated with real-world empathy, although virtual empathy scores were lower than real-world empathy scores for both sexes. Finally, both real-world empathy and virtual empathy are positively related to social support but real-world empathy demonstrated a 5-6 times stronger relationship. The findings show that spending time online does not displace face-to-face time nor reduce real-world empathy, and suggest that perhaps the lack of nonverbal cues in the online world contributes to overall lower levels of virtual empathy compared to the real world. The negative effects of being online upon empathy appear to be due to specific activities such as video gaming rather than total quantity of online time. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Now, not only is stalking a recognised criminal offence, acts associated with stalking behaviour have finally been properly defined in legislation. Further, the role of technology in digital stalking offences, frequently termed as acts of cyberstalking, has been duly highlighted. The prosecution of such cyberstalking offences is reliant on the forensic analysis of devices capable of communication with a victim, in order to identify the offender and evidence the offending content for presentation to a court of law. However, with the recent proliferation of anonymous communication services, it is becoming increasingly difficult for digital forensic specialists to analyse and detect the origin of stalking messages, particularly those involving mobile devices. This article identifies the legal factors involved, along with a scenario-based investigation of sample anonymous and spoof SMS (Short Message Service) messages, documenting the evidence that remains on a victim's handset for the purpose of locating an offender, which often may be minimal or non-existent. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach – In total, 143 OPRs on a specific product on Amazon.com were collected as the sample of this study. Using content analysis ratings and observed data in OPRs, the research model was analyzed with the partial least squares (PLS) method. Findings – Results suggest that helpfulness rating and the degree of referencing are positively associated with NPDs’ information adoption, while the extremeness of product rating is negatively associated. Moreover, title attractiveness mitigates the negative relationship between the extremeness of product rating and information adoption. Practical implications – The findings provide interesting insight for NPDs who visit e-commerce sites to learn through electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) communication. OPRs with a higher degree of referencing, higher helpfulness rating, moderate level of product rating, and higher degree of title attractiveness are better adopted by NPDs. Social implications – This paper investigates the value of OPRs for a specific group of information users and suggests that information about products generated by anonymous consumers can be crucial. Originality/value – While extant studies have focussed on the impacts of OPRs on consumers’ purchasing intention and behavior, this paper is among the first attempts to investigate the impacts of OPRs on developers’ information adoption. Therefore, it contributes to the body of knowledge on knowledge transfer from consumers to business as well as the information adoption literature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Article,Scopus

Systems that allow anonymous communication afford freedom to explore identity and discuss taboo topics, but can result in negative disinhibited behavior such as cyberbullying. Identifiable communication systems allows one to reach a known audience and avoid negative disinhibition, but can constrain behavior with concerns about privacy and reputation. One persistent design issue is understanding how to leverage the benefits of anonymity without suffering its drawbacks. This paper presents a case study analysis of question asking on Facebook confession boards (FCBs), a tool popular on some college campuses. FCBs present a unique configuration in which members of an offline community (e.g., a university) anonymously submit content to a moderator who posts it to a Facebook page where others in the community can view it and respond.

In 2012, an evaluation was carried out to collect opinions on its use, on the quality of the instrument and on its experienced effectiveness. We approached 408 residents and 59 residency programme directors with an anonymous online survey. Completed surveys were received from 108 residents (26 %) and 22 programme directors (37 %). The tool was well received among the respondents and proved to be a simple, efficient and effective instrument to prepare for information-rich progress interviews of programme directors with their residents.

Recent studies have demonstrated that these new online contacts can be important informational resources, and can even exert significant influence on individuals' behavior in various contexts. However little is known about how people select their health contacts in these virtual domains. This is because selection preferences in peer networks are notoriously difficult to detect. In existing networks, unobserved pressures on tie formation - such as common organizational memberships, introductions to friends of friends, or limitations on accessibility - may mistakenly be interpreted as individual preferences for interacting/not interacting with others. We address these issues by adopting a social media approach to studying network formation. We study social selection using an invivo study within an online exercise program, in which anonymous participants have equal opportunities for initiating relationships with other program members. This design allows us to identify individuals' preferences for health contacts, and to evaluate what these preferences imply for members' access to new kinds of health information, and for the kinds of social influences to which they are exposed. The study was conducted within a goal-oriented fitness competition, in which participation was greatest among a small core of active individuals. Our results show that the active participants displayed indifference to the fitness and exercise profiles of others, disregarding information about others' fitness levels, exercise preferences, and workout experiences, instead selecting partners almost entirely on the basis of similarities on gender, age, and BMI. Interestingly, the findings suggest that rather than expanding and diversifying their sources of health information, participants' choices limited the value of their online resources by selecting contacts based on characteristics that are common sources of homophily in offline relationships. In light of our findings, we discuss design principles that may be useful for organizations and policy makers trying to improve the value of participants' social capital within online health programs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus

To date, due to barriers in data collection, there has been little research into how our personality relates to the categories of place that we visit. Using the Foursquare LBSN, we have released a web-based participatory application that examines the personality characteristics and checkin behaviour of volunteer Foursquare users. Over a four-month period, we examine the behaviour and the ""Big Five"" personality traits of 174 anonymous users who had collectively checked in 487,396 times at 119,746 venues. Significant correlations are found for Conscientiousness, Openness and Neuroticism. In contrast to some previous findings about online social networks, Conscientiousness is positively correlated with LBSN usage. Openness correlates mainly with location-based variables (average distance between venues visited, venue popularity, number of checkins at sociable venues). For Neuroticism, further negative correlations are found (number of venues visited, number of sociable venues visited). No correlations are found for the other personality traits, which is surprising for Extroversion.

According to this model, anonymity influences social behavior by accentuating the salience of group identity and reducing interpersonal differences, leading to greater group identification and motivation to work for one's own group. As these effects could lead to higher cognitive performance, the goal of the present research was to extend predictions based on the SIDE model on performance in online game-based learning environments. After measuring their prior computing knowledge, 343 Master Degree students were placed in virtual teams on a trivial criterion to perform a series of online quizzes about computing and the Internet. An anonymous (or individuated) username was attributed to each team member to connect to the online learning environment, and information about comparison between teams was used to manipulate the degree of salience of group identity (high versus low). As predicted by the SIDE model, anonymity boosted performance when group identity was salient, but only for students with low prior knowledge. Unexpectedly, it was also found that anonymity boosted the performance of students with high prior knowledge when group identity was not salient. A similar pattern was found for perceived mastery of computing and the Internet. Theoretical and practical implications of the SIDE model are discussed, and specifically its application to social gaming to optimize online learning. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Some social networks, specifically those that are built on the basis of fairness, cannot incentivize members using tangible things and thus require an intangible way to do so. In such networks, a personalized recommender could provide an incentive for members to interact with other members in the community. Behavior-based trust models that generally compute social trust values using the interactions of a member with other members in the community have proven to be good for this. These models, however, largely ignore the interactions of those members with whom a member has interacted, referred to as ""friendship effects."" Results from social studies and behavioral science show that friends have a significant influence on the behavior of the members in the community. Following the famous Spanish proverb on friendship ""Tell Me Your Friends and I Will Tell You Who You Are,"" we extend our behavior-based trust model by incorporating the ""friendship effect"" with the aim of improving the accuracy of the recommender system. In this article, we describe a trust propagation model based on associations that combines the behavior of both individual members and their friends. The propagation of trust in our model depends on three key factors: the density of interactions, the degree of separation, and the decay of friendship effect. We evaluate our model using a real data set and make observations on what happens in a social network with and without trust propagation to understand the expected impact of trust propagation on the ranking of the members in the recommended list. We present the model and the results of its evaluation.

Results: The results of the JSE before and after the course demonstrated preservation of empathy rather than its decline. In addition, there was a statistically significant increase in GRAS scores (p < 0.001), suggesting that the sharing of personal narratives may foster reflective ability and reflective practice among third year students. Conclusion: This study supports previous findings showing that students benefit from peer groups and discussion in a safe environment, which may include the use of a virtual group video platform. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

Over the years, researchers have developed and extended the theory of psychological ownership; however, despite the emphasis placed on this concept, it has not been tested in online contexts, such as virtual communities. In this study, we show how virtual community members develop psychological ownership of their community and discuss the consequences of such ownership. Drawing on the theory of psychological ownership, we develop a research model that explains three routes of psychological ownership: autonomy, membership duration, and self-discrepancy. We also determine three consequences of psychological ownership: satisfaction, self-concept, and knowledge contribution. In this study, we found that maintaining autonomy and creating a better self in the anonymous environment of a virtual community assists in developing psychological ownership of a virtual community. We also determined that psychological ownership increases satisfaction, self-esteem, and contribution quality. This study will help to support and extend the theory of psychological ownership while providing practical insights for community managers by suggesting ways to vitalize virtual communities. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd .

This study sought to replicate those findings with a larger sample while also exploring additional variables related to impaired driving. Method: College students (N = 549) completed an anonymous online survey to assess differences in drinking and driving-related behaviors between alcohol-only users (n = 281) and combined alcohol–energy drink users (n = 268). Results: Combined users were more likely than alcohol-only users to choose to (a) drive when they perceived they were over the.08% BAC limit (35.0% vs. 18.1%, p <.001), (b) drive despite knowing they had too much alcohol to drive safely (36.3% vs. 17.0%, p <.001), and (c) be a passenger when they knew the driver had too much alcohol to drive safely (44.1% vs. 23.6%, p <.001). Combined users were significantly more likely (p <.001) to report indicators of high-risk alcohol use, such as larger number of drinks consumed, number of days drinking, number of days drunk, number of heavy episodic drinking episodes, greatest number of drinks on one occasion, and average hours of consumption. Conclusions: Combined use of alcohol and energy drinks may place drinkers at greater risk when compared with those who consume only alcohol. College students in this sample who combined alcohol and energy drinks were more likely to participate in high-risk driving behaviors than those who consumed only alcohol. © 2015, Alcohol Research Documentation Inc.

However, many are struggling to continue to effectually and effectively engage with an interactive audience so willing to openly speak their minds. Adoption barriers exist that limit the effective use of these and other new innovative technologies. This study confirms that the main barriers to the use of information communication technologies are also reflected in the active use of social media. These include a lack of skill, knowledge, time and resources. Despite confirmation in this and other studies, there is limited research into how businesses can overcome these barriers to more productively utilise social media tools and technologies. This paper investigates the synergistic relationships between university students and small, tourism-related businesses, and how a student-industry project can aid in reducing the barriers of engagement with social media. Online questionnaires collected anonymous responses from participating businesses in 2010 and 2011. It transpired that businesses gained confidence, skills and information while simultaneously providing real-world student experiences that extended beyond the classroom into the wider community. This opportunity offered tourism businesses a point of entry for understanding and utilising these new technologies. © 2014, Taylor & Francis.",Article,Scopus

The purpose of this study was to characterize behavior and predictors of DD in middle-aged adults. Methods: An anonymous online (SurveyMonkey) 60-question survey on DD attitudes and behaviors, particularly cell phone use, was administered to adults who were recruited via fliers posted around public locations (e.g. recreation centers) and email blasts from businesses. Participants were San Diego residents between 30-64 years old, who drove a car at least once a week and owned a cell phone (. n=715). A DD Scale (DDS) based on 15 questions was created. Factor analysis was conducted and a single parsimonious factor with good reliability was determined (Cronbachs alpha .879). Results: The majority of participants were white (69%), female (75%) and/or made >$50,000/year (68%). 65.1% reported texting while stopped at red lights. While driving on the freeway, 20.4% reported spending about 25% of the time on a cell phone. The DDS scores range from 0-54 (mean=12.92). DDS scores were analyzed as a continuous variable to determine if higher scores were associated with specific attitudes or beliefs. Significant predictors of higher scores on the DDS (. p>.05) were: perceiving oneself as capable of talking on the phone while driving and/or texting while driving (i.e. overconfidence in driving abilities), and obligation to take work calls. Conclusions: Work obligations and overconfidence in ones ability to drive while talking/texting are critical areas to intervene in and have large public health implications. Future studies should use the DDS among different populations to determine generalizability. There are numerous opportunities for education, policy and new technologies to expand on this research. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Recruitment was done via school-based list-serves and posters. School sizes ranged from 476 to over 30,000. The validated survey included 38 questions; 17 were specifically related to distracted driving.Results: Four thousand nine hundred sixty-four participants completed the surveys; the average age was 21.8, 66% were female, 82.7% were undergraduates, and 47% were white/non-Hispanic. Additionally, 4,517 (91%) reported phoning and/or texting while driving; 4,467 (90%) of drivers said they talk on the phone while driving; 1,241 (25%) reported using a hands-free device “most of the time”; 4,467 (90%) of drivers reported texting while driving; 2,488 (50%) reported sending texts while driving on the freeway; 2,978 (60%) while in stop-and-go traffic or on city streets; and 4,319 (87%) at traffic lights. Those who drove more often were more likely to drive distracted. When asked about their capability to drive distracted, 46% said they were capable or very capable of talking on a cell phone and driving, but they felt that only 8.5% of other drivers were capable. In a multivariate model, 9 predictors explained 44% of the variance in DD, which was statistically significant, F (17, 4945) = 224.31; P &lt;.0001; R2 = 0.44. The four strongest predictors (excluding driving frequency) were self-efficacy (i.e., confidence) in driving while multitasking (β = 0.37), perception of safety of multitasking while driving (β = 0.19), social norms (i.e., observing others multitasking while driving; β = 0.29), and having a history of crashing due to multitasking while driving (β = 0.11).Conclusions: Distracted driving is a highly prevalent behavior among college students who have higher confidence in their own driving skills and ability to multitask than they have in other drivers’ abilities. Drivers’ self-efficacy for driving and multitasking in the car, coupled with a greater likelihood of having witnessed DD behaviors in others, greatly increased the probability that a student would engage in DD. Most students felt that policies, such as laws impacting driving privilege and insurance rate increases, would influence their behavior. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus

When only considering the child pornography users, 63% (n = 10) were categorized as searchers/viewers, 18.5% (n = 3) were categorized as downloaders, and 18.5% (n = 3) were categorized as exchangers. When discriminating between child pornography consumers, those individuals who only searched for and viewed child pornography were less extraverted than those individuals who reported exchanging Internet child pornography. Higher scores on extraversion may reflect the offender's ability to socially network on the Internet in order to gain access to child pornography (i.e., exchanging/sharing). Significant correlations also suggested a relationship between child pornography behaviors, conscientiousness, and excitement-seeking.

When the behavior occurs in intimate relationships this is called intimate partner violence (IPV). There are many resources available to survivors of IPV in getting out of abusive situations, but the information is not readily available and is not always easy to find. Furthermore, once the survivor has escaped from the abusive situation, there are not many support type resources that are easily accessible, especially to people lacking transportation and to those residing in rural or suburban areas. LEAF is being created to address the issues that arise from limits in physical community support. The acronym stands for lending encouragement, affirming futures. These embody the vision for a system to provide support to those in difficult situations. The system contains three components: a web portal, a privacy-conscious social network, and a mobile app. By providing a web portal, LEAF aims to be a location where abuse survivors and others can find relevant information. The social network provides an online support community unrestricted by geographical diversity. LEAF incorporates new techniques for anonymous communication in social networks to enable information flow over distributed protected content, while safeguarding both personal information and privacy of individuals from unauthorized disclosure.

Today's online markets provide a unique opportunity to test these theories using unobtrusive data. Our study investigates the mechanisms promoting cooperation in an online-auction market where most transactions can be conceived as one-time-only exchanges. We first give a systematic account of the theoretical arguments explaining the process of cooperative transactions. Then, using a large dataset comprising 14,627 mobile phone auctions and 339,517 DVD auctions, we test key hypotheses about the effects of traders' reputations on auction outcomes and traders' motives for leaving feedback. Our statistical analyses show that sellers with better reputations have higher sales and obtain higher prices. Furthermore, we observe a high rate of participation in the feedback system, which is largely consistent with strong reciprocity-a predisposition to unconditionally reward (or punish) one's interaction partner's cooperation (or defection)-and altruism-a predisposition to increase one's own utility by elevating an interaction partner's utility. Our study demonstrates how strong reciprocity and altruism can mitigate the free-rider problem in the feedback system to create reputational incentives for mutually beneficial online trade. © American Sociological Association 2013.",Article,Scopus

In this article, we show that this kind of indiscriminate one-to-many (i.e., monologue) communication, in which the diverse interests of recipients are not considered, may induce a tendency toward egocentrism that interferes with other-oriented concerns, resulting in a reduced inclination to display prosocial behavior. In Experiment 1, participants induced to post a public communication subsequently allocated less money to anonymous strangers in the dictator game than did control participants. In Experiment 2, participants directing a post about participation in an experiment to their Facebook friends volunteered to help code fewer data sheets than did controls. Moreover, an egocentric state was shown to mediate the relationship between indiscriminate one-to-many communication and helping behavior.

The survey consisted of 20 items, gathering demographic data, information on current use of SNS, and opinions regarding the application of SNS into education. Both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered. A total of 142 students, from all years of study, completed the online questionnaire. Only two participants were not current users of social media. Facebook and YouTube had been utilised for educational purposes by 97 and 60 % of participants respectively; 85 % believed that SNS could benefit their learning experience. Only five respondents were not interested in following peers, academic staff, clinicians or professional associations on Facebook. Four key themes emerged: peer collaboration, need for separation between personal and professional realms, complimentary learning and enhanced communication. Students wish to make educational connections via SNS, yet expressed a strong desire to maintain privacy, and a distinction between personal and professional lives.

Through qualitative analysis of the content of various posts, I argue that, contrary to the purported ideology and discourse of anonymity associated with controversial, anonymous online spaces like 4chan, users of the site are in fact highly invested in delimiting and policing the borders of what counts as ""acceptable"" posting behavior within the community, and are also eager to defend themselves from accusations of unfamiliarity with the mores of the community's subcultural practices. These findings are remarkable given that anonymous users gain no consistent reputation among their fellow users by taking part in these practices and have nothing to risk in terms of community prestige. I conclude that member registration and expression of a virtual embodied identity are not required for inspiring investment of user energy in preserving and enforcing the boundaries and culture of a virtual community, and that anonymous spaces like 4chan actually have more in common with communities that depend on persistent user identity than they care to admit. © 2014, Matthew Trammell.",Article,Scopus

Since the anonymous nature of the sellers exists only in the online auction, these types of fraud can only appear in the Internet. A seller may set a low reserve price (reserve price) and he can sell goods at a lower fee because most of the auction sites such as eBay, charge sellers with the reserve price. The seller then disguised as a usual bidder to drive up the bid price in order to achieve the interests of the seller. Such behavior is extremely difficult to be detected or identified. However, this study based on the previous bid arrival modeling study employs the seller's reputation and related characteristics to detect this fraud. In particular, the paper tries to use sample collections and simulations to find similar products in the online auction to analyze the bid arrival features. For the bidding behavior, based on a random process with finite state machine to simulate the bidding behavior, and the hypothesis tests, the paper analyzes the possible cheating sellers to improve to improve revenue and fairness for the online auction sites. © 2014 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",Article,Scopus

Increasing awareness of privacy issues and events such as the Snowden disclosures have led to the rapid growth of a new generation of anonymous social networks and messaging applications. By removing traditional concepts of strong identities and social links, these services encourage communication between strangers, and allow users to express themselves without fear of bullying or retaliation. Despite millions of users and billions of monthly page views, there is little empirical analysis of how services like Whisper have changed the shape and content of social interactions. In this paper, we present results of the first large-scale empirical study of an anonymous social network, using a complete 3-month trace of the Whisper network covering 24 million whispers written by more than 1 million unique users. We seek to understand how anonymity and the lack of social links affect user behavior. We analyze Whisper from a number of perspectives, including the structure of user interactions in the absence of persistent social links, user engagement and network stickiness over time, and content moderation in a network with minimal user accountability. Finally, we identify and test an attack that exposes Whisper users to detailed location tracking. We have notified Whisper and they have taken steps to address the problem.

Inherently, the huge amount of information disseminated and the sensitive information possessed by OSNs prompted several privacy concerns. In order to increase the privacy of OSNs users, several solutions proposed the use of encryption and masking techniques to conceal profile information or the content of exchanged messages. Unfortunately, even when such countermeasures are in place, the OSNs can still infer sensitive information based on the social network structure and the behavior of users. In this paper, we present VirtualFriendShip, a novel solution that allows users to hide their real social network structure, and to browse the OSNs while keeping their actions anonymous. To do so, we introduce the concept of routing friends, which are build upon the social trust and relay other users traffic throughout a decentralized channel.

The dissemination of ICT among youth is leading to the rise of new sets of problems in the classrooms in all levels of schools. More and more teachers are faced with new challenges related to the misuses of the powerful technologies that their students bring into the classroom. The present research studies the experiences that school teachers have with ICTrelated problems among their pupils. Method. An anonymous questionnaire was created and submitted online to an Italian national sample of 1,034 primary, middle and secondary school teachers. The participation was anonymous and voluntary. Results. Half of the respondents affirmed having witnessed some problems related to ICTs among students, ranging from cyberbullying to excessive use to sexting or dangerous behaviours, such as real life meetings with unknown adults met previously online. In most cases the school was directly involved in the solution to the problems, while only a few situations required the intervention of the police. The interviewees strongly supported the idea that schools could and should play a critical role in the ICT education of students. Discussion. This data strongly suggests that teachers of all levels of school, both from metropolitan and rural areas, are already handling a wide range of issues related to the dissemination of ICTs. The problems start early in primary school, but seem to boom in middle school. This leads to important conclusions, most of all that educational and prevention programs should start in the first years of school. The teaching staff, provided with the required and requested support and training, show a positive attitude towards the idea of taking on a more active role in the education of their students in safe and correct ICT use.",Article,Scopus

Endorsements by microbloggers and public figures you connect with gradually replaces the curation originally in the hand of traditional media sources. One expects a social media provider to possess a unique ability to analyze audience and trends since they collect not only information about what you actively share, but also about what you silently watch. Your behavior in the latter seems safe from observations outside your online service provider, for privacy but also commercial reasons. In this paper, we show that supposing that your passive web visits are anonymous to your host is a fragile assumption, or alternatively that third parties - content publishers or providers serving ads onto them - can efficiently recon-ciliate visitors with their social media identities. What is remarkable in this technique is that it need no support from the social media provider, it seamlessly applies to visitors who never post or endorse content, and a visitor's public identity become known after a few clicks. This method combines properties of the public follower graph with posting behaviors and recent time-based inference, making it difficult to evade without drastic or time-wasting measures. It potentially offers researchers working on traffic datasets a new view into who access content or through which channels. Copyright © 2014 ACM.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Barriers to seeking mental health treatment in this group include concerns about time, stigma, confidentiality, and potential career impact. The authors describe a 4-year trial of the Healer Education Assessment and Referral (HEAR) program, designed to increase mental health services utilization (MHSU) and decrease suicide risk (SR) as assessed by an Interactive Screening Program (ISP)at one US medical school. Methods: Over a 4-year period, medical students were engaged in face-to-face, campus-wide, educational group programs and were invited to complete an individual, online, and anonymous survey. This survey contained the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale to assess depression and items to identify suicidal thoughts and behaviors, substance use, distressing emotional states, and the use of mental health treatment. Students who engaged in this ISP by corresponding electronically with a counselor after completing the survey were assessed and when indicated, referred to further treatment. Results: The HEAR program was delivered to 1,008 medical students. Thirty-four percent (343/1,008) completed the online screening portion. Almost 8 % of respondents met the criteria for high/significant SR upon analysis of the completed screens. Ten out of 13 of the students with SR who dialogued with a counselor were not already receiving mental health treatment, indicating that this anonymous ISP identified a high proportion of an untreated, at risk, and potentially suicidal population. MHSU among medical students who completed the survey was 11.5 % in year 1 and 15.0 % by year 4. SR among medical students was 8.8 % in year 1 and 6.2 % in year 4 as assessed by the ISP. Conclusions: This novel interventional program identified at risk, potentially suicidal medical students at one institution. Based on this single-site experience, we suggest that future multisite studies incorporate a comparison group, acquire baseline (prematriculation) data regarding MHSU and SR, and use an individualized yet anonymous identification system to measure changes in individual participants' mental health status over time. © 2014 Academic Psychiatry.",Article,Scopus

Methods: E-mail invitations to complete the Interactive Screening Program, an online anonymous mental health questionnaire, were sent to graduate students. The questionnaire included the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) as well as items assessing suicide behavior, anxiety, negative emotion, substance use, eating behavior, and service utilization. Results: A total of 301 graduate students responded to the questionnaires between 14 July 2010 and 24 January 2012. With regards to suicide, 7.3 % of the sample reported thoughts of suicide, 2.3 % reported having plans for suicide, and 1.7 % had hurt themselves in the past 2 weeks; while 9.9 % had ever made a suicide attempt in their lifetime. Graduate students had PHQ-9 scores indicating mild depression, and more than half endorsed feeling nervous, irritable, stressed, anxious, lonely, or having fights/arguments. In terms of service utilization, 22.2 % of the sample was currently taking some type of medication, and 18.5 % currently in counseling/therapy are females and those with higher PHQ-9 scores more likely to be using services.

However, no such guidelines have been proposed for preteens and teenagers. Further, research shows that children, preteens, and teenagers are using massive amounts of media and those with more screen time have been shown to have increased obesity, reduced physical activity, and decreased health. This study examined the impact of technology on four areas of ill-being - psychological issues, behavior problems, attention problems and physical health - among children (aged 4-8), preteens (9-12), and teenagers (13-18) by having 1030 parents complete an online, anonymous survey about their own and their child's behaviors. Measures included daily technology use, daily food consumption, daily exercise, and health. Hypothesis 1, which posited that unhealthy eating would predict impaired ill-being, was partially supported, particularly for children and preteens. Hypothesis 2, which posited that reduced physical activity would predict diminished health levels, was partially supported for preteens and supported for teenagers. Hypothesis 3, that increased daily technology use would predict ill-being after factoring out eating habits and physical activity, was supported. For children and preteens, total media consumption predicted illbeing while for preteens specific technology uses, including video gaming and electronic communication, predicted ill-being. For teenagers, nearly every type of technological activity predicted poor health. Practical implications were discussed in terms of setting limits and boundaries on technology use and encouraging healthy eating and physical activity at home and at school. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: An anonymous online survey assessed the prevalence of being harassed or bullied in various locations within 20 middle schools (grades 5-9) in New Jersey and New York (N = 10,668). Seven types of bullying-related victimization (teased in an unfriendly way, called hurtful names, physically abused, excluded from a group to hurt feelings, belongings taken/damaged, threatened to be hurt, and negative rumors spread) were examined in 7 locations where each type of victimization could occur (classroom, lunchroom, hallways, gym, playground, bus, or bathroom). RESULTS: Prevalence of victimization types ranged from 4% to 38% depending on location. Prevalence of overall victimization was equal or greater in classrooms compared with other school locations (highest prevalence rates in hallways, classrooms, and lunchrooms), regardless of school demographic characteristics. Victimization in classrooms compared with other school settings was most highly associated with feelings of being unsafe. CONCLUSIONS: Vigilant attention to bullying is needed across all school environments and especially in the classroom context, which may mistakenly be perceived as a more protected area. Indeed, middle school classrooms are not safe havens. © 2014, American School Health Association.",Article,Scopus

However, new online services changed the meaning behind ""browsing the Web"" and require a fresh look at the problem. Platforms such as YOUTUBE or LAST. FM have started to replace the traditional media channels (cinema, television, radio) and media distribution formats (CD, DVD, Blu-ray). Particularly social networks (e.g., FACEBOOK) attracted whole new, particularly less tech-savvy audiences. Advances in mobile technologies made browsing ""on-the-move"" the norm and changed the user behavior, often being influenced by the user's location and context in the physical world. Commonly used datasets, such as web server access logs or search engines transaction logs, are inherently not capable of capturing the browsing behavior of users in all these facets. DOBBS (DERI Online Behavior Study) is an effort to create such a dataset in a non-intrusive, completely anonymous and privacy-preserving way.

Computer-mediated communication has made it possible for participants to remain anonymous and, simultaneously, enter into a public space to share personal thoughts about a stigmatized and taboo subject. This has also created new and unique opportunities to study a type of communication that was previously very difficult to access. Most of the participants on the studied forum are teenagers or young adults who communicate based on a need to recognize themselves in others, and to receive acknowledgement for their thoughts, feelings and experiences, thereby gaining acceptance and understanding. However, there are also destructive elements in the form of an exchange of suicide methods and participants exhorting each other to go ahead with their suicide plans. Moreover, participants are able to practise suicide behaviour in a mediated, conversational form, thereby making the act seem less fearful. The participants are furthermore involved in constructing and re-constructing a counter-discourse in which established society's perceptions and values concerning suicide are questioned, as expressed in a critique against public institutions, mainly psychiatry.",Article,Scopus

Unlike health care workers, there is little information on the attitudes to and predictors of vaccination among medical students, and their attitudes towards institutional strategies for improving rates are unknown. Methods. This cross-sectional study evaluated the effect of three influenza vaccination promotional strategies (Web page, video and tri-fold brochure) on medical students' intention to get vaccinated and associated factors. A total of 538 medical students were asked to answer an anonymous questionnaire assessing the intention to get vaccinated after exposure to any of the promotional strategies. Sociodemographic data collected included: sex, age, university year, influenza risk group and cohabiting with member of a risk group. Results: Four hundred twenty-one students answered the questionnaire, of whom 312 (74.1%) were female, 113 (26.8%) had done clinical rotations, and 111 (26.6%) reported intention to get the flu shot. Logistic regression showed the web group had a greater intention to get vaccinated than the reference group (OR: 2.42 95% CI: 1.16-5.03). Having done clinical rotations (OR: 2.55 95% CI: 1.36-4.38) and having received the shot in previous flu seasons (OR: 13.69 95% CI: 7.86-23.96) were independently associated with the intention to get vaccinated. Conclusion: Given that previous vaccination is a factor associated with the intention to get vaccinated, education on vaccination of health care workers should begin while they are students, thereby potentiating the habit. In addition, the intention to get vaccinated was greater during the clinical phase of the university career, suggesting this is a good time to introduce promotion strategies. Online promotional campaigns, such as a thematic Web to promote vaccination of health workers, could improve the intention to get vaccinated. © 2013 Mena et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,Scopus

This roadside survey was part of the European DRUID (Driving Under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol and Medicines) Project. Methods: Drivers were selected for a voluntary and anonymous study using a stratified multistage cluster sampling procedure in collaboration with the Mobile Police Service. Samples of oral fluid were taken using the Statsure Saliva Sample (Statsure Diagnostic Systems, Framingham, MA), and the drivers' gender, age, and nationality were recorded. Samples of oral fluid were analyzed for alcohol or drugs, for a total 28 psychoactive substances. Results: One hundred eighty-four roadside survey sessions were conducted and 10,004 drivers were asked to participate. The refusal rate was 5.8 percent. Psychoactive substances were found in 4.8 percent of the 9410 oral fluid samples analyzed. Alcohol was detected in 0.3 percent, medicinal drugs in 3.2 percent, and illegal drugs in 1.5 percent of the samples. Illegal drugs were significantly more frequently detected in samples from southeastern Norway including the capital Oslo, whereas medicinal drugs were more frequently detected in samples from southeastern Norway excluding Oslo. Illegal drugs were significantly more frequently detected in samples from drivers in urban areas than in rural areas, though there were no significant differences for alcohol and medicinal drugs. Medicinal drugs were most commonly found in samples collected during the daytime on weekdays (3.8%), and illegal drugs were most commonly found in samples collected during late night on weekdays or weekends (2.8%-3.2%). The most commonly found substances were the sleeping agent zopiclone (1.4%), the main active substance in cannabis tetrahydrocannabinol (1.1%), and the sedative drug diazepam (0.7%). The prevalence of driving with drug concentrations above the Norwegian legislative limits for blood was estimated to be about 0.2 percent for alcohol, 0.6 percent for illegal drugs, and about 1.3 percent for medicinal drugs. Conclusions: The incidence of drink driving was very low, though driving after using psychoactive illegal or medicinal drugs was more frequent. Supplemental materials are available for this article.

However, because the experimenter gives up the direct control over the participants' environments and behavior, concerns about the quality of the data collected in online settings are pervasive. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of conducting online performance evaluations of user interfaces with anonymous, unsupervised, paid participants recruited via MTurk. We implemented three performance experiments to re-evaluate three previously well-studied user interface designs. We conducted each experiment both in lab and online with participants recruited via MTurk. The analysis of our results did not yield any evidence of significant or substantial differences in the data collected in the two settings: All statistically significant differences detected in lab were also present on MTurk and the effect sizes were similar. In addition, there were no significant differences between the two settings in the raw task completion times, error rates, consistency, or the rates of utilization of the novel interaction mechanisms introduced in the experiments. These results suggest that MTurk may be a productive setting for conducting performance evaluations of user interfaces providing a complementary approach to existing methodologies.

Aims: To determine the impact of recreational drug toxicity on the utilisation of emergency medical services and subsequent drug use. Design and Methods: A total of 2472 UK participants completed an anonymous online cross-sectional questionnaire. The use of emergency medical services for acute recreational drug and/or ethanol toxicity and its impact on drug use were surveyed. Results: Four hundred and sixty-one (19%) had previously utilised emergency medical services following drugs/ethanol; of these, 57% (259) attended a hospital emergency department, out of which 59% (152) needed hospital admission. Forty-three percent (49 of 113 respondents) believed their most recent episode that required medical assistance was due to using ""too much drug"". Forty-five percent (50 of 112 respondents) stated they would continue to use or increase their drug use. Ten percent (11) reported that the episode had resulted in them stopping use. Conclusions: A significant proportion of individuals used hospital/prehospital emergency services for acute toxicity after recreational drugs and/or ethanol use.

Pearson chi-square analyses indicated that location and several sexual behaviors were significantly related to how often the men reported the degree to which they had safer sex with clients.

Method: A cross-sectional, convenience sample of 184 active-duty service members, recruited via online websites for military populations, provided data on two facets of alcohol misuse (drinking more than intended and feeling the need to reduce use) via traditional self-report and the UCT.

However, whether these double standards are necessarily due to the fact that one party is a business company while the other is a consumer was not addressed. The results of our two experimental studies, conducted among 277 (Study 1) and 264 (Study 2) participants from a Western European country by means of an anonymous self-administered online survey, demonstrate that the respondents were not only harsher in their judgments of unethical business (vs. consumer) behavior, but also harsher in their judgments of unethical behavior by prosperous (vs. non-prosperous) consumers and prosperous (vs. non-prosperous) business companies (Study 1). Further, they were also less tolerant of unethical behavior by consumers (vs. one's best friend) and business companies with which they have a less than good (vs. a good) relationship (Study 2). These results indicate that double standards are due to differences in perceived wealth between subjects and in the individual's relationship with subjects. These two factors imply that double standards are not strictly reserved to consumer-business relations, but might also be used in business-business and consumer-consumer relations. Further, these results indicate that companies need to be aware of the fact that good financial figures may backfire as they might lead individuals to be more critical of a company's deceptive practices. Moreover, these findings point to the importance of businesses investing resources-and to keep investing resources-in developing a good relationship with stakeholders as these good relationships lead to stakeholders being less prone to make moral condemnations. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Article,Scopus

The social media data are available on the popular on-line social network websites with rich personal information, which can be analyzed for connectivity and user behaviors. In this work, we study the problem of preserving sensitive paths in social networks. We examine the new concept called k-anonymous path privacy and propose two algorithms, based on the greedy approach with two different types of edges, namely Partially-Visited (PV) edges and None-Visited (NV) edges, which minimally perturbed the edge weights to achieve the path anonymity under different requirements. The numerical experiments showing the characteristics of the proposed algorithms are given. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are feasible to achieve the k-anonymous path privacy, with different performances on directed and un-directed weighted graphs, and could be applied to different privacy requirements. © 2012 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus

They share the same location but they are socially isolated and anonymous to each other. Anonymity and isolation are considered to be among the most common factors for aggressive behavior on the road (road rage). This paper presents a novel way to reduce anonymity between drivers. Furthermore argues that reducing anonymity by making drivers socially aware of each other reduces road rage. This awareness is achieved by introducing online social networks to the Car2X communication domain. The main focus of the paper is the evaluation of this idea which was carried out in two phases: In context of an on-site study and as part of an online experiment within a social network. The aim was to demonstrate the correlation between the anonymity level among drivers and the aggressiveness. The results confirmed that lowering the anonymity lever by revealing common personal interests between two drivers reduces their aggressive behavior. Copyright © 2012 ACM.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Applications of this behavior are in sheep or duck shepherding and fishing. In this paper, a new algorithmic model is developed for online formation control, decision making, behavior selection, and motion planning of a team of homogeneous and anonymous (no leader and follower) flocking robots which simultaneously perform object collecting and shepherding tasks. The model's architecture is enriched with various complex flocking actions such as flock deformation, flock split and merge, flock expansion, and flock obstacle avoidance. Contributions of this paper include (i) defining a new class of problems for flocking robots called Simultaneous Object Collecting and Shepherding (SOCS) problem, (ii) incorporating online obstacle sensing and avoidance methods in the flocking behavior, and (iii) developing a fuzzy expert system for determining the strategy of environment exploration. The fuzzy inference engine provides an effective way to minimize the time spent on collecting objects while maximizing the gain obtained by object collection, in a way that the flock's formation and integrity is maintained. The proposed model was implemented on a number of simulations and produced rational and satisfactory results.",Conference Paper,Scopus

In this paper, we study the impact of differential behavior of users on performance in typical social network-based information dissemination applications. We classify users into either collaborative or rational (probabilistically collaborative) and study the impact of this classification and the associated behavior of users on the performance on such applications. By experimenting with real-world social network traces, we make several interesting observations. First, we show that some of the existing social graphs have high routing costs, demonstrating poor structure that prevents their use in such applications. Second, we study the factors that make probabilistically collaborative nodes important for the performance of the routing protocol within the entire network and demonstrate that the importance of these nodes stems from their topological features rather than their percentage of all the nodes within the network. © 2012 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus

While the Internet allows unprecedented freedom of expression and public opinion gathering, it also facilitates anonymity and facelessness, which increases the possibility of damage caused by deviant online behavior. The Veri?cation of Identity Policy was aimed at fostering a more responsible Internet culture. At the beginning, it faced ?erce resistance from civic groups but media coverage of innocent and high-pro?le victims has changed public opinion and facilitated the implementation of the policy in 2006. Although arguments about freedom of anonymous expression and relief of damage by restrictions on freedom continue, the Veri?cation of Identity Policy is evaluated here as a partial success, having maintained public support despite the possibility of restrictions on freedom of expression.

Researchers have been trying to address this problem by focusing on discovering influential entities inside social platforms to guide their ranking algorithms. Often these entities correspond to people or organizations already influential in the real-world. However, not everywhere in the world is there a right to and protection of free speech. In countries where the traditional media cannot report the truth, anonymity becomes a necessity for citizens who want to exercise their right of free-speech in the service of their community. But is it possible for anonymous individuals to become influential and gain the trust of a community? In this paper, we discuss the case of a community of Twitter citizen reporters, located in a Mexican city plagued by the drug cartels fighting for control of territory. Our analysis shows that the most influential individuals inside the community were anonymous accounts. Neither the Mexican authorities, nor the drug cartels were happy about the real-time citizen reporting of crime or anti-crime operations in an open social network such as Twitter, and we discovered external pressures to this community and its influential players to change their reporting behavior.

However, the few studies conducted regarding a potential relation between coat color and domestic cat personality have shown mixed results, even though many people believe that differently colored cats have distinct personalities. Understanding how humans might perceive personality in relation to coat color may have important ramifications regarding whether cats are relinquished to shelters or adopted from them. In order to assess human perceptions of differently colored cats, we conducted an anonymous, online survey, using a 7-point Likert scale and 10 terms describing personality traits that were chosen based on previous studies of animal personality. This survey examined how people assigned these given terms (active, aloof, bold, calm, friendly, intolerant, shy, stubborn, tolerant, and trainable) to five different colors of cats (orange, tricolored, white, black, and bi-colored). There were significant differences in how participants in this study chose to assign personality terms to differently colored cats. For example, participants (n = 189) were more likely to attribute the trait ""friendliness"" to orange cats, ""intolerance"" to tri-colored cats, and ""aloofness"" to white and tri-colored cats. No significant differences were found for ""stubbornness"" in any colors of cats. White cats were seen as less bold and active and more shy and calm than other colors of cats. While survey respondents stated that they placed more importance on personality than color when selecting a companion cat, there is some evidence that they believe the two qualities are linked. We anticipate our findings will be relevant to further study in domestic cat personality and to those who work in animal rescue, particularly in how shelters promote differently colored cats and educate potential adopters. © ISAZ 2012 Printed in the UK.",Article,Scopus

WOM is especially important in the hospitality and tourism industry, whose intangible products are difficult to evaluate prior to their consumption. When WOM becomes digital, the large-scale, anonymous, ephemeral nature of the Internet induces new ways of capturing, analyzing, interpreting, and managing the influence that one consumer may have on another. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of electronic WOM (eWOM) on a tourism destination choice, using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Further, an effort was employed to determine the effect of past travel experience on using eWOM and TPB constructs. Design/methodology/approach: A structural equation modeling procedure was applied to the examination of the influences of eWOM on attitudes towards visiting Isfahan, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and travel intention. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilised in order to analysing the relations between these constructs and past travel experience. The research model was tested empirically using a sample of 296 inbound tourists who had experience within the online communities and travelled to Isfahan during the period of research. Findings: Findings indicate that online WOM communications have a significant impact on attitudes toward visiting Isfahan, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intention to travel. In addition, travel experience has a significant impact on using eWOM and TPB constructs. Practical implications: The paper suggests that eWOM activity is more complex than previous research has argued. Managers should consider various eWOM facets and try to motivate tourists for participating in online travel communities and to build online travel communities with characteristics such usefulness and ease of use. Originality/value: There has been a lot of marketing research on eWOM but none has focused on covering eWOM in tourism industry and its impact on tourism destination choice by adding new dimension of eWOM to the theory of planned behavior.

The objective of this study was to assess preventive and clinical attitudes of the participants in an educational intervention on oral cancer in Spain based on scientific journals. Members of the Spanish Board of Dentists and Stomatologists participated in an online, cross-sectional study, using an anonymous, self-administered questionnaire. There were 791 general dental practitioners (GDPs) invited to participate in the study. The large majority reported that they deliver tobacco-cessation counseling (93.6 percent) as well as advice on alcohol consumption (66.6 percent), but advice on vegetable intake was less frequently provided (42.4 percent). Alcohol intake advice, routine mucosa exploration, and biopsy performance on lesions suspicious of malignancy are preventive attitudes related to training. Compared with those who did not benefit from CE courses or did so only once, the GDPs who took four or more CE courses showed a doubling in the odds of giving alcohol advice to their patients and a tenfold increased odds of performing mucosa check on a routine basis; they were 3.5 times as likely to take biopsies of suspicious lesions.

Barriers to implementation include the need for training and limited awareness or experience. Research may not always convince mental health professionals (MHPs). Adding the 'voice' of mental health service users (MHSUs) in collaborative learning may help. Involving MHSUs in face-face education can be difficult. We had previously been unable to engage MHPs in online discussion with MHSUs. Here we assessed the feasibility of short online courses involving MHSUs and MHPs. Methods: We ran three e-health courses, comprising live interactive webcast, weeks access to a discussion forum, and final live interactive webcast. We recruited MHPs via posters, newsletters, and telephone from a local NHS trust, and online via mailing lists and personal contacts from NHS trusts and higher education. We recruited MHSUs via a previous project and an independent user involvement service. Participants were presented with research evidence about e-health and asked to discuss topics using professional and lived experience. Feasibility was assessed through recruitment and attrition, participation, and researcher workloads. Outcomes of self-esteem and general self-efficacy (MHSUs), and Internet self-efficacy and confidence (MHPs) were piloted. Results: Online recruiting was effective. We lost 15/41 from registration to follow-up but only 5/31 that participated in the course failed to complete follow-up. Nineteen MHPs and 12 MHSUs took part and engaged with each other in online discussion. Feedback was positive; three-quarters of MHPs indicated future plans to use the Internet for practice, and 80% of MHSUs felt the course should be continued. Running three courses for 31 participants took between 200 to 250 hours. Before and after outcome measures were completed by 26/31 that participated. MHP Internet self-efficacy and general Internet confidence, MHSU self-esteem and general self-efficacy, all seemed reliable and seemed to show some increase. Conclusions: Collaborative learning between MHSUs and MHPs in a structured online anonymous environment over a one-week course is feasible, may be more practical and less costly than face-face methods, and is worthy of further study. © Ashurst et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Interpersonal communication is believed to mediate campaign effects through the creation of social learning environments. Therefore, many HIV and AIDS strategies (e.g. entertainment education programmes) use mass media channels for conveying messages on the one hand and spurring interpersonal communication among target groups on the other hand. However, it seems hard to find solid evidence that mass media campaigns are able to stimulate interpersonal communication. Simultaneously, there is a rising interest in the use of new technologies for HIV and AIDS prevention. As a result of their unique characteristics, such as interactivity and anonymity, they could be more appropriate than traditional channels to stimulate interpersonal communication. To gain insights in the challenges and opportunities of new technologies for primary HIV/AIDS prevention, this article presents the findings of a case study carried out at the University of the Western Cape. This study aimed at developing, implementing and evaluating an anonymous online discussion platform for students to share experiences and discuss sensitive subjects. The discussion forum was used in three ways: compulsory (through curriculum integration), semi-voluntarily and voluntarily. An extensive evaluation provided strong evidence that the online discussion forum was only successful when formally integrated into the curriculum. The most important opportunity of the formally integrated online forum relates to the creation of a social learning environment. The anonymous character of the online platform allayed fear for stigma and discrimination and removed cultural barriers concerning the inappropriateness of discussing HIV/AIDS related issues. As a result, the platform created a space in which students discussed freely, considered old and new ideas, acquired knowledge, and learned to esteem varying views on the subjects of discussion. Although no assertions can be made on the effects of these outcomes on sustainable changes in attitudes or behaviour, these findings indicate that participating in an anonymous online platform can instigate students to reflect on HIV/AIDS in a different way. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Respondents included 438 individuals (60% female) with an average age of 23.1 (SD = 12.32), yielding a response rate of 22%. Approximately 15.4% of the sample had previously smoked hookah, while 6% used hookah within the past 30 days. Common motivating factors associated with smoking hookah included socializing/partying (29%), peer influence (27%), and for relaxation (25%). Correlations were calculated comparing hookah use to other high risk behaviors with the two highest correlations consisted of 30-day tobacco use (r = 0.67) and marijuana (r = 0.39). The results from this study suggest hookah use is limited to a small percentage of students. Students appear to smoke hookah for social reasons and underestimate the addictive properties associated with the product. Researchers and practitioners need to develop and evaluate specific interventions to educate college students about the health hazards associated with hookah use. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA) 2011.",Article,Scopus

The authors investigated the question: Can differences be found in the behaviours and attitudes of our two cohorts to working in teams? This would allow the authors to better manage the project and reflect on its success/failure. Design/methodology/approach: The authors ran a one semester cross-cultural software development project. An anonymous online survey measured three temporal dimensions commonly used in time-at-work studies and seven cultural dimensions. The results are discussed in the context of cohort behaviours, project outcomes/outputs and related literature. Findings: Differences were found along the temporal dimensions of punctuality, time boundaries and awareness of time use. While conformance with national cultural stereotypes was evident, only selected statements in the cultural dimensions showed significant differences. Some gender differences were also identified. Research limitations/implications: Generalizability beyond the domain of ICT students would need further investigation. Though larger numbers would strengthen the paper's claims, some statistically significant results show differences between Australian and Singaporean cohorts requiring further investigation. Practical implications: Education providers should carefully design, implement and monitor cross-cultural learning opportunities to prepare graduates to work in global teams. Originality/value: The project provided rare cross-cultural and virtual team experience and revealed that providing this experience is likely to be effort intensive for all parties, involve higher project and people risks but potentially deliver greater (life-long) learning gains. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Article,Scopus

Patients and students often have extensive experience of using the Internet for health information and support, and many health organisations are increasingly trying out online tools, while many healthcare professionals are unused to, and have reservations about, online interaction. Methods. We ran three week-long collaborative learning courses, in which 19 mental health professionals (MHPs) and 12 mental health service users (MHSUs) participated. Data were analysed using a discursive approach to consider the ways in which participants interacted, and how this contributed to the goal of online learning about using Internet technologies for mental health practice. Results. MHSUs and MHPs were able to discuss issues together, listening to the views of the other stakeholders. Discussions on synchronous format encouraged participation by service users while the MHPs showed a preference for an asynchronous format with longer, reasoned postings. Although participants regularly drew on their MHP or MHSU status in discussions, and participants typically drew on either a medical expert discourse or a ""lived experience"" discourse, there was a blurred boundary as participants shifted between these positions. Conclusions. The anonymous format was successful in that it produced a ""co-constructed asymmetry"" which permitted the MHPs and MHSUs to discuss issues online, listening to the views of other stakeholders. Although anonymity was essential for this course to 'work' at all, the recourse to expert or lay discourses demonstrates that it did not eliminate the hierarchies between teacher and learner, or MHP and MHSU. The mix of synchronous and asynchronous formats helped MHSUs to contribute. Moderators might best facilitate service user experience by responding within an experiential discourse rather than an academic one. © 2012 Smithson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Thus, the current study examines some of the characteristics and motivations common among answerers, who produce health-related answers to questions asked by anonymous others in a social Q&A site, Yahoo! Answers. An online survey questionnaire was distributed to top and recent answerers to investigate their demographics, areas of health expertise, and other characteristics related to answering behaviors online. Also, 10 motivation factors are proposed and tested in the survey: enjoyment, efficacy, learning, personal gain, altruism, community interest, social engagement, empathy, reputation, and reciprocity. Findings show that altruism is the most influential motivation, while personal gain is the least. Enjoyment and efficacy are more influential than other social motivations, such as reputation or reciprocity, although there are some variations across different groups of answerers. Motivational factors among top answerers or health experts are further analyzed. The findings of this study have practical implications for promoting health answerers to share knowledge and experiences in social contexts.

Additionally, research has shown that text messaging is common in several countries, and despite drivers acknowledging the high risk involved in doing so, drivers continue to engage in this behaviour - regardless of legislation banning it. A nationwide online survey in New Zealand, of 1057 respondents, collected anonymous self-report data regarding the frequency of cell phone use (conversing and text messaging) while driving, beliefs concerning the safety of conversing or text messaging while driving. This article presents part of the results of that study - focusing on text messaging behaviour and risk perception regarding text messaging while driving. Over half of respondents surveyed reported sending or reading between 1 and 5 text messages while driving in a typical week. Despite this, 89% of participants agreed that text messaging while driving in general impairs driving performance. There were no gender differences between the number of text messages read and sent. Age was found to be an important indicator of participant's willingness to engage in text messaging while driving, with younger drivers more likely to engage in this behaviour. The implications of these findings for future research and countermeasure development are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Article,Scopus

Vengefulness is linked to needs for retribution (until satisfied) for a perceived offense. An unsettled issue is whether these antecedents are also manifested in electronic expressions known as cyber smearing. Free speech by constitution and legislation in the US, UK, EU have been held as a cherished value and basic right, but the rights to free speech are not unlimited and in fact are legally constrained to varying degrees regarding issues such as related to privacy, defamation, and harassment. Cyber smearing is a campaign waged to damage the credibility or reputation of others over the Internet. Using a randomized study we investigated rash impulsivity, vengefulness, and anonymous identity (a virtual self), as factors contributing to cyber smearing, and we found that when people who lack self-control and have tendencies to seek revenge especially when shrouded in anonymity of virtual self and concomitantly have high tendencies toward cyber smearing. We also found that those who hold the view in which ethical standards are situational and relative amplifies these cyber smearing behaviors. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Article,Scopus

The first introducing personal factors, i.e., age, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability and intellect (R2 = 0.131, p &lt; 0.001). The second controlled for variables in the first model and introduced driver-related variables, mileage, penalty points, and frequency of accidents with assumed responsibility (R2 = 0.253, p &lt; 0.001).

This study sought to describe demographics, usage patterns, and perceived benefits for women participating in Internet pregnancy loss support groups. Methods: We requested permission to post an anonymous Internet survey on large and active United States Internet message boards for women with miscarriages and stillbirths. The study purposefully oversampled stillbirth sites and included both closed- and open-ended questions. The University of Michigan Institutional Review Board approved the study. Closed-ended questions were summarized and evaluated with bivariate analysis. We performed a qualitative analysis of open-ended data using an iterative coding process to identify key themes. Results: Of 62 sites queried, 15 granted permission to post the survey on 18 different message boards. We collected 1,039 surveys, of which 1,006 were complete and eligible for analysis. Women were typically white, well educated, and frequent users. They noted message boards helped them to feel less isolated in their loss and grief and they appreciated unique aspects of Internet communication such as convenience, access, anonymity, and privacy. Pregnancy loss message boards are an important aspect of support for many bereaved mothers. African-American women seem to be substantially underrepresented on-line despite being at higher risk for stillbirth. Conclusion: Internet message boards serve a unique function in providing support for women with miscarriage and stillbirth.

We applied an experimental research design in a virtual community environment and provide evidence that anonymous feedback significantly influences consumers' decision behavior and that increased deviations from an initial decision negatively affects individual product satisfaction.

Most of the existing solutions establish friendship relationships based on users behavior or declared trust.

This network is used as a basis to provide useful and high quality recommendations. Based on F2Frec, we propose new metrics, such as usefulness and similarity (among users and their respective friend network), necessary to enable friendship establishment and to select recommendations. We define our proposed metrics based on users' topic of interest and relevant topics that are automatically extracted from the contents stored by each user. Our experimental evaluation, using the TREC09 dataset and Wiki vote social network, shows the benefits of our approach compared to anonymous recommendation.

Users are given the freedom to fail to respond to some of these requests, or can choose to submit fake identity properties, so as to reduce the risk of identification, surveillance or observation of any kind. However, this freedom has led to serious security and privacy incidents [23], due to the role users'identities play in establishing social and privacy settings. In this paper, we take a step toward addressing this open problem, by analyzing the dynamics of social identity verification protocols. We use a game theoretical framework to describe a simple two-player general sum game describing the behavior of a server system (like Facebook) that provides utility to users. Users can choose to register a new identity using the true information, false information or no information (and remain anonymous). Likewise, the server may choose to believe and add the prospective social user, believe and yet fail the registration, or do nothing. We show criteria on the relative payoff of providing no information (anonymity) that produce various Nash equilibria. We then show that in the presence of a binding agreement to cooperate, most players will agree to share information. This result is consistent with reality, and suggests that sites that require users to authenticate with identity information should be prepared to provide strong guarantees on privacy in order to ensure that a social contract is maintained and the sites are not damaged. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an analytical model is developed to study the dynamics underpinning users'registration is social media. © 2011 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus

The population of military veterans attending college is rapidly growing as veterans return from Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF). We sought to describe patterns of student veterans' health-related behaviors and how they might differ from their nonveteran peers. Design. We analyzed data from the 2008 Boynton College Student Health Survey (CSHS). Setting. CSHS participants completed an anonymous online survey. Subjects. The CSHS sampled students (n = 8651) attending public, private, 2-year, and 4-year postsecondary educational institutions in Minnesota. Measures. The CSHS included items on substance use (including alcohol and tobacco), safety, nutrition, and physical activity. Analysis. We described demographics of OEF/OIF veteran, non-OEF/OIF veteran, and nonveteran students and used Poisson regression to compute adjusted relative risks (ARRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to characterize associations between veteran status and health behaviors. Results. After controlling for demographics, veteran students reported more safety-, tobacco-, and alcohol-related risk behaviors compared to nonveteran students. For instance, compared to the nonveteran reference group, the ARR for past year smokeless tobacco use and physical fighting among for OEF/OIF veterans was 1.76 (95% CI = 1.31-2.35) and 1.48 (95% CI = 1.22-1.79) respectively. Veteran and nonveteran students display similar weight-related behaviors, though OEF/ OIF veteran students were more likely to engage in strengthening exercises. Conclusions. There are specific health risk behaviors that are particularly relevant for veterans attending postsecondary institutions. As veterans enroll in postsecondary education, there is a unique window of opportunity for health promotion in this population.

Data were collected using an anonymous online survey (baseline n = 2,589; postintervention n = 3,024). In the baseline survey, students substantially misperceived peer norms regarding bullying perpetration and support for probullying attitudes. As predicted by social norms theory, they thought bullying perpetration, victimization, and probullying attitudes were far more frequent than was the case. Also as predicted, variation in perceptions of the peer norm for bullying was significantly associated with personal bullying perpetration and attitudes. Using print media posters as the primary communication strategy, an intervention displaying accurate norms from survey results was conducted at each of the five school sites. A pre-/postintervention comparison of results revealed significant reductions overall in perceptions of peer bullying and probullying attitudes while personal bullying of others and victimization were also reduced and support for reporting bullying to adults at school and in one's family increased. The extent of reductions across school sites was associated with the prevalence and extent of recall of seeing poster messages reporting actual peer norms drawn from the initial survey data. Rates of change in bullying measures were highest (from around 17% to 35%) for the school with the highest message recall by students after a one-and-a-half-year intervention. Results suggest that a social norms intervention may be a promising strategy to help reduce bullying in secondary school populations. © The Author(s) 2011.",Article,Scopus

The willingness to share information by those people with a proself orientation--that is, those who put more emphasis on their personal benefit--can be increased by providing photographs of the other group members. The information-sharing behavior of prosocials, however, suffers from such a deletion of anonymity. In an online experiment, we examined how information-sharing behavior of proselfs may be increased without negatively influencing the information-sharing behavior of prosocials in an online setting. It was shown that even proselfs share information if the group members are visualized in a homogeneous way, while prosocials' information-sharing behavior is not impaired by this visualization. In addition, the results suggest that people's perceived homogeneity of the online group, as well as the importance of the collective goal, are the underlying processes of this effect. These results have important practical implications for the design of online information-sharing settings.",Article,Scopus

We conducted a comparative study of student reflective writings produced using either an electronic (blog) format or a traditional written (essay) format to assess differences in content, depth of reflection and student preference. Methods: Students in internal medicine clerkships at two US medical schools during the 2008-2009 academic year were quasi-randomly assigned to one of two study arms according to which they were asked to either write a traditional reflective essay and subsequently join in faculty-moderated, small-group discussion (n = 45), or post two writings to a faculty-moderated group blog and provide at least one comment on a peer's posts (n = 50). Examples from a pilot block were used to refine coding methods and determine inter-rater reliability. Writings were coded for theme and level of reflection by two blinded authors; these coding processes reached inter-rater reliabilities of 91% and 80%, respectively. Anonymous pre- and post-clerkship surveys assessed student perceptions and preferences. Results: Student writing addressed seven main themes: (i) being humanistic; (ii) professional behaviour; (iii) understanding caregiving relationships; (iv) being a student; (v) clinical learning; (vi) dealing with death and dying, and (vii) the health care system, quality, safety and public health. The distribution of themes was similar across institutions and study arms. The level of reflection did not differ between study arms. Post-clerkship surveys showed that student preferences for blogging or essay writing were predicted by experience, with the majority favouring the method they had used. Conclusions: Our study suggests there is no significant difference in themes addressed or levels of reflection achieved when students complete a similar assignment via online blogging or traditional essay writing. Given this, faculty staff should feel comfortable in utilising the blog format for reflective exercises. Faculty members could consider the option of using either format to address different learning styles of students. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2011.",Article,Scopus

Freed, 'In the Spirit of Selden Bacon: The Sociology of Drinking and Drug Problems', Sociology Compass 4/10 (2010): 856-868, 10.1111/j.1751-9020.2010.00325.x. Author's introduction: In 1943, the sociologist Selden Bacon proposed studying drinking behavior from a 'sociologic' perspective. Since then a problem-oriented approach - a sociology of problem drinking and problem drug use, not a sociology of drinking and drug use behavior - has dominated the literature on alcohol and other drugs. However, the literature reveals a sociology of drinking and drug problems in the spirit of the research that Bacon proposed. The sociology of drinking and drug problems exposes the considerable influence of 'sociologic' factors on problem drinking and problem drug use and, in particular, that problem drinking and problem drug use are not caused exclusively by biologic traits. However, more research needs to analyze the normal use of alcohol and other drugs to better understand the connection between substance use and social life. Author recommends: Bacon, Selden D. 1943. 'Sociology and the Problems of Alcohol: Foundations for a Sociologic Study of Drinking Behavior.'Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol 4 402-45. In this seminal article, Bacon proposes a research plan for the 'sociologic' study of drinking behavior. Bacon urges sociologists to examine the functions of alcohol consumption; the manner and method by which alcohol is consumed, including where, when, and with whom; and drinking norms, sanctions, and sanctioning agents. Bacon also recommends that sociologists who study alcohol consider race, socio-economic status, and occupation, social and cultural mores and institutional demands, social change, and how drinking comportment, habits, customs, and roles are learned. Becker, Howard S. 1953. 'Becoming a Marihuana User.'American Journal of Sociology 59: 235-42. Becker argues that regular marijuana use is a learned behavior. Based on 50 interviews with musicians, laborers, and white-collar professionals who use marijuana, Becker suggests that novice marijuana users do not continue to use marijuana unless they learn from experienced users: (i) how to properly smoke marijuana, (ii) how to recognize its effects, and (iii) how to enjoy those effects. Fingarette, Herbert. 1988. Heavy Drinking: The Myth of Alcoholism as a Disease. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press. Fingarette proposes that Americans have been so inundated with the idea that alcoholism is a disease that they overlook personal and scientific observations that indicate heavy drinkers can control their alcohol consumption. Heavy drinking is not a disease, Fingarette states, but a 'central activity' in the lives of some drinkers: heavy drinkers organize their daily life around drinking and look for settings that promise and promote heavy drinking. Heavy drinking, similar to all central activities, carries momentum and becomes a difficult pattern to break. Levine, Harry G. 1978. 'The Discovery of Addiction: Changing Conceptions of Habitual Drunkenness in America.'Journal of Studies on Alcohol 39: 143-74. In this classic article, Levine argues that the mid-19th century development of market capitalism and middle-class society in America led to the discovery of addiction. Rapid social change and related social problems prompted medical professionals, religious leaders, and the American public to regard alcohol as inherently addicting and alcohol consumption as dangerous for society. Levine also traces the historical evolution of ideas concerning the cause and nature of alcohol addiction. Lindesmith, Alfred R. 1968. Addiction and Opiates, Rev. edn. Chicago, IL: Aldine Publishing Company. Lindesmith finds that opiate users experience addiction only if they learn by observation or experience how to recognize opiate withdrawal, link withdrawal to their opiate use, and then use opiates again to relieve their withdrawal distress. According to Lindesmith, persons who do not become 'enlightened' about the symptoms of opiate withdrawal do not become addicted to opiates. MacAndrew, Craig and Robert B. Edgerton. 1969. Drunken Comportment: A Social Explanation. Chicago, IL: Aldine Publishing Company. MacAndrew and Edgerton question the conventional wisdom that drinkers lose control when they consume alcohol. MacAndrew and Edgerton acknowledge that alcohol affects drinkers pharmacologically, but they also provide a wealth of anthropological evidence that reveals drunken comportment is 'societally sanctioned.' Cultural norms and values socialize individuals how to behave during different drinking situations. Pittman, David J. and Charles R. Snyder. (eds) 1962. Society, Culture, and Drinking Patterns. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, Inc. This volume consists of some of the most influential analyses of alcohol consumption and alcoholism in the social science literature, organized under five different themes: (i) the anthropology of drinking, (ii) modern setting, (iii) social structure and subcultures, (iv) the origin and patterns of alcoholism, and (v) responsive movements and systems of control. Reinarman, Craig and Harry G. Levine. (eds) 1997. Crack in America: Demon Drugs and Social Justice. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press. Reinarman and Levine bring together essays about the crack scare in America that occurred during the late 1980s and the early 1990s. This important work in the sociology of alcohol and other drugs covers four broad areas: (i) myths and realities, (ii) crack in comparable societies, (iii) the price of repression, and (iv) punitive prohibition and harm reduction. Waldorf, Dan, Craig Reinarman, and Sheigla Murphy. 1991. Cocaine Changes: The Experience of Using and Quitting. Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press. Waldorf, Reinarman, and Murphy suggest that a 'stake in conventional life'- a family, finances, a job, and social status, for example - helps heavy cocaine users control their use or even quit using cocaine. Health problems and diminishing pleasure from cocaine also help control use. Whatever cocaine users value and prioritize in their lives can be more powerful than the pharmacological effects of cocaine.

We argue that the relevance of recommendation system is also desirable in many real applications. Here relevant means relevance in a human perceptible way. Relevant recommendations not only increase the users' trust to the system but are extremely useful for the vast number of anonymous user as their recommendations may only be made based on the current item. In this paper, we empirically examine the relation between the relevance of recommendations and the corresponding CTR with a few representative ItemCF algorithms through online data from a TV show/movie website, Hulu. Experiments show that algorithms with higher overall CTR may not correspond to higher relevance. Thus CTR may not be the optimal metric for online evaluation of recommender systems if producing relevant recommendations is of importance. Copyright 2010 ACM.",Conference Paper,Scopus

This inevitably leads to the problem of being able to choose the right one which is mostly done today by trial-and-error. However this gets tricky if it involves sharing privacy sensitive information with the service e.g. in the case of health and well-ness services. A customer's trust in a new online service is known to increase based on testimonials (or observable behavior) of people within a social distance (friends, friends-of-friends etc). Linking testimonials to users requires releasing one's social network information which by itself is privacy invasive. The paper presents the concept of an anonymous social stamp which can be assigned to anonymous statements and help prove that the statement was made by a particular member of an external social networking site. Trust can then be derived based on the social distance between the persons concerned: the person who made the statement and the person verifying the statement. A possible implementation of the concept is shown with the existing infrastructure of RSA keys already in use by social networking sites. The concept is applicable for the new services that can create confidence in new users by revealing anonymous data sharing configurations of other users with the service.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Zero accountability via anonymous online identities and divergent interests result in selfish behavior that can disrupt or manipulate networks for personal gain. While ""reputation systems"" are recognized as a promising means to establish social control for such communities, developing reliable reputation systems remains a challenge. Several unaddressed threats still limit the effectiveness of reputation systems. Furthermore, most existing work on reputations has focused on accurate reputations for stable systems, but not examined the implications of integrating user reputations into scalable distributed infrastructures. The primary goal of this paper is to investigate and address the critical open challenges that limit the effectiveness of reputations. First, we identify a thorough taxonomy on reputation management, and use it as our framework to classify adversarial threats that compromise reliable operation of reputation systems. Second, we survey existing research to address these threats. Finally, we present our solutions to address the two leading reasons for erroneous and misleading values produced by reputation systems today, i.e., user collusion and short-lived online identities. We believe that this paper not only serves as an introduction to reputation systems design, but will also help researchers deploy reliable reputation solutions that contribute towards improving the performance of large distributed applications. © The Author(s) 2010.",Article,Scopus

The ad serving companies that handle such campaigns record users' behavior that leads to impressions of campaign ads, as well as users' responses to such impressions. This is summarized and reported to the advertisers to help them evaluate the performance of their campaigns and make better budget allocation decisions. The most popular reporting statistics are the click-through rate and the conversion rate. While these are indicative of the effectiveness of an ad campaign, the advertisers often seek to understand more sophisticated long-term effects of their ads on the brand awareness and the user behavior that leads to the conversion, thus creating a need for the reporting measures that can capture both the duration and the frequency of the pathways to user conversions. In this paper, we propose an alternative data mining framework for analyzing user-level advertising data. In the aggregation step, we compress individual user histories into a graph structure, called the adgraph, representing local correlations between ad events. For the reporting step, we introduce several scoring rules, called the adfactors (AF), that can capture global role of ads and ad paths in the adgraph, in particular, the structural correlation between an ad impression and the user conversion. We present scalable local algorithms for computing the adfactors; all algorithms were implemented using the MapReduce programming model and the Pregel framework. Using an anonymous user-level dataset of sponsored search campaigns for eight different advertisers, we evaluate our framework with different adgraphs and adfactors in terms of their statistical fit to the data, and show its value for mining the long-term behavioral patterns in the advertising data. © 2010 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2).",Conference Paper,Scopus

We report relative number of book references overall, the age of these references, and those titles that were multiply cited, either through citations in both online encyclopedias or multiple entries in either one of them. We compare the percentages of book references allotted to matching subject categories. We note the distributions of references according to book publishers and compare propensities for citing high-level research volumes versus introductory textbooks and popularizations. Finally, we examine the credentials of the authors of the cited works, providing information on the universities and disciplines in which their authors or editors received their doctoral degrees and their most current academic or professional affiliation. We conclude that in this comparison of a small but carefully matched set of entries in the brain and behavioral sciences, both encyclopedias offer references to solid materials and that any differences in quality indicators represent matters of degree rather than any clear-cut advantage that is exclusive to one or the other. Finally, we provide as an annotated checklist for librarians serving the brain and behavioral sciences of the books multiply cited by these encyclopedias at the time of this study.",Article,Scopus

Three integrity factors were assessed: academic environment, personal cheating behaviors, and perceived seriousness of specific cheating behaviors. Methods: After receiving local IRB approval, an anonymous online survey was disseminated to PA students at the University of Detroit Mercy. Ninety-four potential participants were contacted through the university's email account. Respondents were directed to an online site to complete the academic integrity survey. This descriptive study was part of a larger study of students in the whole college, including the PA department, in order to determine baseline data prior to instituting a college-wide honor code. Results: The response rate was 52% (n = 49). The majority of respondents (86%) indicated ""never"" having seen another student cheat during an exam. Respondents perceived cheating during a test or exam campuswide as occurring ""never"" (47%) or ""very seldom"" (42%). All (100%) respondents reported that they had ""never"" personally turned in workdone by another student or purchased from a ""paper mill."" All participants (100%) responded ""never"" to not taking vital signs and reporting approximates. A few respondents (8%) reported getting test questions and answers from another student. Respondents' perceptions of the seriousness of cheating behaviors varied. Working with others when asked to do individual workwas considered ""not cheating"" by 14% of respondents; 35% indicated that not taking vital signs and reporting approximates was less serious than cheating. Conclusions: PA students have a self-reported high level of integrity in general course assignments, tests and exams, and clinical courses. This apparent high level of academic integrity may be a result of admissions practices and of various program practices throughout the curriculum, including an honor agreement acknowledged by PA students that reinforces what is expected of them.",Article,Scopus

Because of its open editing model -allowing anyone to enter and edit content- Wikipedia's overall quality has often been questioned as a source of reliable information. Lack of study of the open editing model of Wikipedia and its effectiveness has resulted in a new generation of wikis that restrict contributions to registered users only, using their real names. In this paper, we present an empirical study of user contributions to Wikipedia. We statistically analyze contributions by both anonymous and registered users. The results show that submissions of anonymous and registered users in Wikipedia suggest a power law behavior. About 80% of the revisions are submitted by less than 7% of the users, most of whom are registered users. To further refine the analyzes, we use the Wiki Trust Model (WTM), a user reputation model developed in our previous work to assign a reputation value to each user. As expected, the results show that registered users contribute higher quality content and therefore are assigned higher reputation values. However, a significant number of anonymous users also contribute high-quality content. We provide further evidence that regardless of a user s' attribution, registered or anonymous, high reputation users are the dominant contributors that actively edit Wikipedia articles in order to remove vandalism or poor quality content.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Individual feedbacks on the quality of past association are the fundamental building blocks of reputation systems. Careful consideration in aggregating feedbacks from different sources is in fact very important in computing a reliable value for trust worthiness to facilitate decision making in a social dilemma situation like that of online market places. In this paper we are considering a possible improvement to a reputation model like that of eBay, with our interest lying on investigating how the cooperativeness and population of cooperators would evolve if the weight of the feedback source was assigned on the basis of past association between players. We categorize the feedback source as direct source, gray source and opposition friendly source to define an aggregation method for trustworthiness assessment that considers applying a dynamically computed weight to each source of feedback. Our result shows that breaking feedback sources on the basis of acquaintance and assigning weight accordingly favors the evolution of cooperativeness in the player society as compared to models which do not classify the feedback sources.

There was also no relationship between the blogger and the journalist who deduced the blogger's identity; the court therefore focussed on the tort of misuse of private information and countervailing public interests, such as freedom of expression. This article describes the approach of the court and considers the earlier case of Mahmood v Galloway ([2006] EWHC 1286 (QB)) concerning an undercover journalist's attempt to prevent publication of photographs showing what he looked like.

In this paper, we report on a project in which 1st-year students attended F2F sessions and engaged with an anonymous online questioning environment. The differences between students' F2F and online behaviour led to intended and unintended consequences. The purpose of this paper is to explore these intended and unintended consequences of technology use. The project was undertaken over a 3-year period, starting in 2004. In 2004, a pilot project was conducted based on a class of 35 students studying a 1st-year programming course in information systems. The investigation was again conducted in 2005 for the same course, this time with 63 students. In 2006, the project was extended to a class of 610 1st-year commerce students studying an introductory information systems course. In all cases, students met F2F and when online, engaged with an anonymous Web/SMS collaborative tool. The intended consequence was that a blending of F2F with online interaction extended student engagement beyond the limitation of a classroom and provided a forum for further collaboration and consultation. The intended outcome was achieved. An unintended consequence was that the tool provided the lecturer with diagnostic information that was used to impact on pedagogical designs. This was often a result of students taking on an online personality that would very often be extremely frank and honest about the manner in which the course was conducted, and how learning was taking place. The findings show that students used the tool in ways that exceeded the envisaged intention, and student use of the tool positively impacted on the curriculum, pedagogy and general running of the course. The paper concludes that integration of online engagement with F2F teaching adds value to the teaching and learning experience.",Article,Scopus

Specifically, we propose that cross-cultural differences in interpersonal motivation (autonomy vs. affiliation) are illustrated by choices individuals make when deciding whether or not to remain anonymous while communicating online. Autonomy is often valued in Western societies, whereas Eastern societies tend to emphasize affiliation, suggesting that individuals in Western societies will gravitate toward online communities that allow lower levels of anonymity, while individuals in Eastern societies will be more likely to seek out online communities that promote higher levels of anonymity.

In 2007, an evaluation of the first Australian pilot Web-based alcohol and other drug (AOD) counselling initiative, known as CounsellingOnline, was completed.This paper explores whether CounsellingOnline enhanced AOD service accessibility for clients. Design and Methods: Service utilisation data (n = 2004) and client survey data (n = 277) were collected and analysed to evaluate service responses, service impact, client characteristics and client satisfaction. Comparative client data were obtained from a state-wide conventional counselling dataset (Alcohol and Drug Information System; n = 19 283) and a statewide telephone counselling database (DirectLine;n = 59 863). Results: Service responses, such as fast counsellor connection speed, low client attrition and anonymous login, contributed to good service accessibility. CounsellingOnline clients differed from conventional and telephone counselling clients, representing much higher proportions of young, employed and female clients. Notably, the majority of CounsellingOnline sessions occurred outside standard business hours. Discussion and Conclusions: CounsellingOnline has showed enhanced AOD service accessibility through its service responsiveness, high level of after-hours service utilisation, and appeal to a client group that differs from those seen in conventional and telephone AOD counselling services. The capacity of Web-based services such as CounsellingOnline to enhance service accessibility is significant, particularly for clients whose access to conventional treatment services is limited. © 2009 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs.",Article,Scopus

With the rapid increase in electronic or online communication, bullying is no longer limited to schools. The goal of the current investigation was to examine the overlap among targets of, and the similarities between, online and in-school bullying among Internet-using adolescents. Additionally, a number of common assumptions regarding online or cyberbullying were tested. Methods: An anonymous Web-based survey was conducted with one thousand four hundred fifty-four 12- to 17-year-old youth. Results: Within the past year, 72% of respondents reported at least 1 online incident of bullying, 85% of whom also experienced bullying in school. The most frequent forms of online and in-school bullying involved name-calling or insults, and the online incidents most typically took place through instant messaging. When controlling for Internet use, repeated school-based bullying experiences increased the likelihood of repeated cyberbullying more than the use of any particular electronic communication tool. About two thirds of cyberbullying victims reported knowing their perpetrators, and half of them knew the bully from school. Both in-school and online bullying experiences were independently associated with increased social anxiety. Ninety percent of the sample reported they do not tell an adult about cyberbullying, and only a minority of participants had used digital tools to prevent online incidents. Conclusions: The findings have implications for (1) school policies about cyberbullying, (2) parent education about the risks associated with online communication, and (3) youth advice regarding strategies to prevent and deal with cyberbullying incidents. © 2008, American School Health Association.",Article,Scopus

Making friends online has attracted particular attention as a risky behaviour, especially when this leads to offline meetings, as has giving out personal information online. This article, based on the 'UK Children Go Online' survey, seeks to explain the online communication of 9-19-year-olds in terms of their offline socio-psychological characteristics (shyness, life satisfaction, risk-taking), family communication patterns and online behaviour/skills. Findings show that older teens engage in more online communication activities than do younger children and so encounter more communication risks. Although girls communicate more on the internet, this seems not to put them more at risk. It was found that children's offline social psychological characteristics, particularly their levels of life satisfaction and risk-taking, influence their online communication, with different online communication activities being predicted by different patterns of off- and online characteristics. There are weak indications that, in families which have a more conversational style of communication, teens may take fewer risks online, including a lower likelihood of meeting online friends offline. Multiple regression analyses show that those children and teens who are less satisfied with their lives and who have become more frequent and skilled internet users are more likely to value the internet as a communicative environment in which they feel more confident than they do offline, particularly in relation to the potential for anonymous communication. Since this in turn leads some into risky activities, the implications for research and policy are discussed.",Article,Scopus

An examination was conducted of November 2004 Channel 2 threads and entries about the dissemination of images and video files of the hostage murder.

Based on this premise and guided by various psychological principles that characterize Internet communication and behavior, on the one hand, and by factors related to the provision of emotional support, on the other, an Israeli project with the Hebrew acronym SAHAR was established. The idea behind SAHAR was to initiate an anonymous, confidential online environment that would attract people in a crisis situation and offer them a listening ear, mental support, and warmth, provided by anonymous, skilled helpers. At the heart of this exclusively online service is a content-rich Hebrew website (http://www.sahar.org.il) that provides relevant and continuously updated information for people in need. Accessed through the site, SAHAR offers, in addition, personal communication to users through synchronous and asynchronous support. For group communication, SAHAR provides online forums (a chat room will soon be launched). The website is accessed more than 10,000 times a month, or 350 times a day, a considerable number relative to Israel's small population. Approximately 1000 personal contacts with SAHAR itself take place, each month, of which at least a third of the distressed users are clearly suicidal. The forums receive over 200 new messages a day. SAHAR on numerous occasions has participated in rescue operations of individuals who threatened to commit suicide or were actually in the process of trying. In many other cases, a supportive conversation or a referral to appropriate help resources prevented hasty decisions by highly distressed, desperate people contemplating suicide. Feedback by users also indicates the success of SAHAR as a unique psychological application on the Internet. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Article,Scopus

This study examined the phenomenon of online infidelity in chat rooms, a process whereby individuals involved in a long-term committed relationship seek computer synchronous, interactive contact with opposite-sex members. The following factors were investigated: (a) what elements and dynamics online infidelity involves and how it happens; (b) what leads individuals specifically to the computer to search for a relationship ""on the side""; (c) whether individuals consider online contacts as infidelity and why or why not; and (e) what dynamics chat room users experience in their marriages. The results revealed three theoretical constructs that represent married individuals' chat room experiences. The first construct, Anonymous Sexual Interactionism, refers to these individuals' predilection for anonymous interactions of a sexual nature in chat rooms. The allure of anonymity gains extra importance for married individuals, who can enjoy relative safety to express fantasies and desires without being known or exposed. The second, Behavioral Rationalization, denotes the reasoning that chat room users present for conceiving their online behaviors' as innocent and harmless (despite the secrecy and highly sexual nature). The third, Effortless Avoidance, involves chat room users' avoidance of psychological discomfort by exchanging sexual messages with strangers. Happily married individuals also join such rooms, a trend that is also discussed. Together, these constructs symbolize chat room dynamics and serve as a foundation upon which further studies can build. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Article,Scopus

This has occurred in reponse to the need to provide flexible learning choices for cohorts of students having a wide range of mathematical backgrounds, often insufficient for their chosen fields of study. Many students have difficulty with detailed written assignments which contain substantial amounts of mathematics, and need to be given extra incentive to spend time doing the necessary preparatory exercises. Furthermore, it is necessary that students revise previously learned concepts, preferably without using up valuable lecture time. Students need encouragement to do this, rather than trusting that they will magically remember what is needed along the way. To make such preparatory and revision work compulsory means assessing it in some way, which is an insurmountable task to do manually, but well suited to a computer. The importance of providing timely and accurate feedback to students regarding their progress cannot be underestimated. However it is impractical to provide this feedback to large classes unless either plenty of staff, or an automated system, is available. With appropriate feedback, students are more likely to do more than the minimum requirements, and so their achievement and interest in the subject will be enhanced. The MacQTEX online quiz project ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5]) was developed in the Department of Mathematics, Macquarie University, Sydney, and for the past three years has been used for formative assessment in undergraduate mathematics units. Following its success in improving students' learning outcomes, in 2005 the Department of Statistics introduced it in an elementary Operations Research unit. Quizzes are presented online as interactive PDF documents. Students may repeat a quiz as many times as is necessary to achieve a passing score, thereby getting valuable practice. Randomisation of numerical parameters and other aspects of the questions means that each instance of a quiz is different. A quiz is marked on submission to the server and students receive immediate feedback. At this time detailed solutions are revealed, which, rather than being general solutions, use the actual random parameters of each question instance. Question types include the usual multiple choice, multiple response (the correct answer is comprised of several choices), and fill-in-the-answer style. The latter may take a numerical answer, or a mathematical expression. Equivalence of mathematical expressions is recognised, so answers such as √x and x1/2, for example, are both acceptable. With the use of a system such as MacQTEX, it is possible to begin to overcome some of the difficulties of teaching large classes. In such classes it is easy for students having marginal interest or ability to fall behind, or to feel anonymous and isolated. It is an interesting contradiction that the introduction of an automated system can encourage student contact with a real live staff member, particularly in the case of students who would not normally approach a lecturer or request help with their learning. In this paper we describe the MacQTEX quiz project itself, and the positive effects it has had on student performance and behaviour. We describe the ways in which quiz system makes it possible to identify struggling students early in the semester, and the action that can then be taken, giving these students the sense that their lecturers care that they succeed. Additionally we discuss how the system provides teaching staff with an immediate indication of the level of understanding the students have reached. If necessary, more time can then be spent on topics that have been more challenging for the students than expected. © 2006 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus

In spite of this, little research has been devoted to understanding the effects of self-awareness in CMC. To fill this void, this study examined the effects of individuals' public and private self-awareness in anonymous, time-restricted, and synchronous CMC. Two experiments were conducted. A pilot experiment tested and confirmed the effectiveness of using a Web camera combined with an alleged online audience to enhance users' public self-awareness. In the main study users' private and public self-awareness were manipulated in a crossed 2 × 2 factorial design. Pairs of participants completed a Desert Survival Problem via a synchronous, text-only chat program. After the task, they evaluated each other on intimacy, task/social orientation, formality, politeness, attraction, and group identification. The results suggest that a lack of private and public self-awareness does not automatically lead to impersonal tendencies in CMC as deindividuation perspectives of CMC would argue. Moreover, participants in this study were able to form favorable impressions in a completely anonymous environment based on brief interaction, which lends strong support to the idealization proposed by hyperpersonal theory. Findings are used to modify and extend current theoretical perspectives on CMC. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Article,Scopus

Online adaptive systems provide flexible services to a mass of clients/users for maximizing some system goals; they dynamically adapt the form and the content of the issued services while the population of clients evolve over time. The idea of online genetic algorithms (online GAs) is to use the online clients response behavior as a fitness function in order to produce the next generation of services. The principle implemented in online GAs, ""the application environment is the fitness"", allow to model highly evolutionary domains where both services providers and clients change and evolve over time. The flexibility and the adaptive behavior of this approach seems to be very relevant and promising for applications characterized by highly dynamical features such as in the web domain (online newspapers, e-markets, websites and advertising engines). Nevertheless the proposed technique has a more general aim for application environments characterized by a massive number of anonymous clients/users which require personalized services, such as in the case of many new IT applications.

Analyses indicated that participants who reported a higher number of sexual partners and more frequent sexual intercourse tended to be more educated and more likely to be nonheterosexual. The HBM constructs, as a set, reliably predicted participants' sexual behaviors. Self-efficacy was the strongest predictor within the HBM. Furthermore, acculturation moderated the predictive power of the HBM with respect to intercourse frequency. The main limitation of the study is that the measure of HBM, which was not designed to target Asian immigrants, was psychometrically poor.

In contrast to the usual question of how socially desirable a certain behaviour is perceived by the interviewee, a study performed at the University of Bremen divided this question into 'talking about' and 'admitting' a certain behaviour, where 'talking about' meant to mention a certain behaviour in public while 'admitting' implied that one has already done it oneself. Additionally, the study compared two different computer mediated interview modes: a web-based questionnaire (ONLINE) and an innovative method called internet assisted personal interview (IAPI), which used a desktop video conference system to facilitate communication between the interviewer and the interviewee. This was done in order to compare the tendency to give socially desirable answers in an anonymous (ONLINE) and non-anonymous (IAPI) interview setting.

This is achieved by exploring the internet's shared nature in order to provide a public musical space where anonymous users can meet and be found performing in collective sonic art pieces. The system itself is an interface-decoupled musical instrument, in which a remote user interface and a sound processing engine reside with different hosts in an extreme scenario where a user can access the synthesizer from any place in the world using the World Wide Web.

E-mail addresses vary in the amount of identifying information they convey (e.g., name, gender, status). It is proposed that the amount of identifying information an email address contains is a predictor of usage for a specific purpose. However, it is assumed that not all people choose email addresses in a rational way, according to the optimal fit between amount of identifying information and purpose of the E-mail. Thus, the role of other factors is tested as well. An online survey on German Internet users showed that it is common to have more than one E-mail address.

The fair trading protocol provides an overall solution for a trading process with offline anonymous credit card payments. With the exploding growth of electronic commerce on the Internet, the issue of fairness1,2 is becoming increasingly more important. Fair exchange protocols have already been broadly used for applications such as electronic transactions,3,4 electronic mails,5,6and contract signing.7 Fairness is one of the critical issues in online transactions and related electronic payment systems. Many electronic payment systems have been proposed for providing different levels of security to financial transactions, such as iKP,8SET,9 NetBill,10 and NetCheque.11 In a normal electronic commerce transaction, there is always a payer and a payee to exchange money for goods or services. At least one financial institution, normally a bank, should be present in the payment system. The financial institution plays the role of issuer for the payer and the role of acquirer for the payee. An electronic payment system must enable an honest payer to convince the payee of a legitimate payment and prevent a dishonest payer from using other unsuitable behavior. At the same time, some additional security requirements may be addressed based on the nature of trading processes and trust assumptions of the system. Payer, payee, and the financial institution have different interests and the trust between two parties should be as little as possible. In electronic commerce, the payment happens over an open network, such as the Internet, and the issue of fairness must be carefully addressed. There is no fairness for involved parties in the existing popular payment protocols. One target of this article is to address the fairness issue in the credit card payment process. In the existing credit card protocols, the financial institution that provides the credit card service plays the role of online authority and is actively involved in a payment. To avoid the involvement of financial institutions in normal transactions and to reduce running costs, some credit card-based schemes with offline financial authority have been proposed.12 Another target of this article is to avoid the online financial institution for credit card service in normal transactions. © 2004 Taylor &amp; Francis.",Article,Scopus

We then use auction data gathered using an Internet-based data collection software agent to examine reserve price shilling using a probit model. We give evidence of reserve price shilling and then show factors that lead to this behavior.",Conference Paper,Scopus

WebWho visualizes where people are located in a large university computer lab and allows students to virtually locate one another and communicate via an instant messaging system. As WebWho is there to be accessed through any web browser, it requires no programming skills or special software. It may also be used from outside the computer lab by students located elsewhere. The sender's user name is normally automatically added to the instant messages, but the messages can also be sent anonymously. We were interested in finding out if the sender's conscious hiding of his or her identity seemed to be reflected in the content of anonymous messages, and how these differed from those with identified senders. Awareness of presence seems to be one of several factors influencing message composition, both content and structural aspects. At this stage, we have primarily focused on examining how different factors affects the content of the messages. We cross-analysed the messages for content in relation to parameters such as sender location (collocated, distributed and distant) and sender status (anonymous vs. identified), in order to find out whether awareness of presence seems to be an influencing factor. Computer-mediated communication (CMC) is often claimed to be a sort of hybrid between spoken and written interaction [c.f. Ferrara, Brunner & Whittemore (1991) and several others]. We compared the messages that were sent using the instant messaging tool in WebWho with data from other types of CMC (email, chat) and also with corpora of spoken language and traditionally written language. The aim of the study was primarily to investigate awareness of presence affects on instant messaging, and only secondarily to investigate spoken vs. written features of the texts. Results show that awareness of both physical and virtual presence affects the content of the messages, and that these factors affects the text differently. Sender status, the nature of the computer-mediated medium, and the written mode shape the messages as well. Results show that the students use the messaging system to support collaborative work and coordinate social activities, and extensively for playful behaviour.",Article,Scopus

Many personalities develop aside from real world life due to its anonymous environment. Virtual world interactions are bringing about new psychological illnesses ranging from netaddiction to technostress, as well as online personality disorders and conflicts in multiple identities that exist in the virtual world. Presently, there are no standard therapy models for the virtual environment. There are very few therapeutic environments, or tools especially made for virtual therapeutic environments. The goal of our research is to provide the therapy model and middleware tools for psychologists to use in virtual therapeutic environments. We propose the Cyber Therapy Model, and Projective Agents, a tool used in the therapeutic environment. To evaluate the effectiveness of the tool, we created a prototype system, called the Virtual Group Counseling System, which is a therapeutic environment that allows the user to participate in group counseling through the eyes of their Projective Agent. Projective Agents inherit the user's personality traits. During the virtual group counseling, the user's Projective Agent interacts and collaborates to recover and increase their psychological growth. The prototype system provides a simulation environment where psychologists can adjust the parameters and customize their own simulation environment. The model and tool is a first attempt toward simulating online personalities that may exist only online, and provide data for observation.",Article,Scopus

In an exploratory study of these new types of monitoring, 53 employed individuals responded to an anonymous, on-line, open-ended query about their related experiences. Content analysis of the resulting textual data explored two issues: the extent to which electronic monitoring shaped employees' behavior and the reasoning processes by which employees decided whether or not the monitoring was a negative experience. Results of the content analysis suggested that behavior was influenced by the capabilities of monitoring in combination with managerial expectations. Employees' attitudes about monitoring appeared to be dependent, in part, on the uses to which monitoring information was put. Finally, an unexpected focus on sexual content on the Internet revealed that employees had assimilated managerial concerns about organizational reputation.",Article,Scopus

This article helps to ground the policy debates by examining some fundamental aspects of anonymous social behavior and current controversies over anonymous communications. It is a companion to the article in this issue, ""Anonymous Communication Policies for the Internet: Results and Recommendations of the AAAS Conference."" It examines the social character of anonymous communication and the ways that anonymous communication has played important roles for professionals such as journalists and the police. It also explains some of the new technological supports for anonymous communication on the Internet. The openness, decentralization, and transnational character of the Internet challenge the efficacy of traditional control mechanisms and have raised issues related to accountability, law enforcement, security and privacy, governmental empowerment, and e-commerce. Yet, to ban or restrict all anonymous communication online because of the harms it could bring would deny its benefits to those people who may legitimately gain from it. This article helps to understand how to balance these positions. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus

That behavior can span the range from simple mischievous antics to more serious expressions of psychopathology, including depression, sociopathy, narcissism, dissociation, and borderline dynamics. In some cases the deviant behavior may be a process of pathological acting out - in others, a healthy attempt to work through. Several factors must be taken into consideration when explaining online deviance, such as social/cultural issues, the technical infrastructure of the environment, transference reactions, and the effects of the ambiguous, anonymous, and fantasy-driven atmosphere of cyberspace life. In what we may consider an ""online community psychology,"" intervention strategies for deviant behavior can be explored along three dimensions: preventative versus remedial, user versus superuser based, and automated versus interpersonal.",Article,Scopus
